              "snippet": "### National Summary\n\n#### Overall Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening. Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.... #### Labor Markets\n\nEmployment levels were largely stable in recent weeks, and demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors. In most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing weaker demand, elevated economic uncertainty, and, in some cases, increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies. Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities. Nevertheless, labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies. Wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace, and labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.\n\n#### Prices\n\nPrices rose further during the reporting period. Several District reports indicated that input costs increased at a faster pace due to higher import costs and the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions. Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept their selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and in response to pushback from price-sensitive clients. However, there were also reports of firms in manufacturing and retail trades fully passing higher import costs along to their customers. Waning demand in some markets reportedly pushed prices down for some materials, such as steel in the Sixth District and lumber in the Twelfth District.... #### Highlights by Federal Reserve District\n\n##### Boston\n\nEconomic activity expanded slightly, with modest growth in consumer spending. Employment was flat, as both hiring and layoffs increased modestly. Prices increased at a moderate pace, although certain cost pressures intensified. Home sales were flat from a year earlier. The outlook was neutral to cautiously optimistic, but contacts saw mostly downside risks.\n\n##### New York\n\nEconomic activity continued to decline slightly. Employment held steady, and wage growth remained modest. The pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed. Manufacturing activity held steady after a summer uptick. Consumer spending increased modestly, buoyed by mid- to upper-income households. Businesses did not expect activity to increase much in the months ahead.\n\n##### Philadelphia\n\nBusiness activity increased slightly in the current Beige Book period. Employment levels increased slightly, and wages again rose at modest pre-pandemic rates. Prices continued to rise moderately. Activity increased slightly for nonmanufacturers and moderately for manufacturers. Generally, firms expect modest growth over the next six months, but heightened economic uncertainty remains.\n\n##### Cleveland\n\nFourth District business activity was flat in recent weeks, but contacts expected activity to increase modestly in months ahead. Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Contacts said that cost growth remained robust, while their selling prices increased modestly.... ##### Richmond\n\nThe regional economy grew modestly in recent weeks. Consumer spending continued to grow modestly and import activity rose. Manufacturing activity declined slightly and growth in the remaining industries was largely flat. Employment levels were largely unchanged and wage growth remained moderate. Price growth remained moderate, overall, despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector.\n\n##### Atlanta\n\nThe Sixth District economy was unchanged. Employment levels were steady, and wages grew modestly. Prices increased moderately. Consumer spending fell, and leisure travel softened. Home sales declined, and commercial real estate was unchanged. Transportation declined. Manufacturing grew slightly. Energy grew moderately, and agriculture was healthy.\n\n##### Chicago\n\nEconomic activity in the Seventh District was flat. Consumer spending increased modestly; construction and real estate activity increased slightly; employment was flat; nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity; business spending declined slightly; and manufacturing activity declined modestly. Prices rose moderately, wages were up modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\n\n##### St. Louis\n\nEconomic activity and employment levels have remained unchanged since our previous report. Contacts continue to report that immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages. Prices have increased moderately, with contacts reporting that inflation is eroding consumer purchasing power. Banking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report, with overall credit conditions remaining strong. Agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated. The outlook remains slightly pessimistic.... ##### Minneapolis\n\nDistrict economic activity contracted slightly. Labor demand softened, according to firms and job seekers, though wage growth remained moderate. Price increases remained modest, but input price pressures increased. Manufacturing and commercial real estate were flat, but most other sectors contracted. Agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.\n\n##### Kansas City\n\nEconomic activity in the Tenth District fell slightly over the past month. Employment levels declined slightly, and bankers noted consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately. Though activity fell recently, expectations for sales and employment in 2026 were broadly optimistic. Expectations for the pace of price growth in 2026 were similarly above 2025 levels.\n\n##### Dallas\n\nEconomic activity was flat. Service sector activity contracted mildly. Retail sales fell, while the pace of manufacturing output growth moderated. Loan demand grew, but the housing market remained weak, and drilling and well completion activity was flat. Employment dipped, and wage growth was modest. Price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. Outlooks deteriorated with slowing demand, policy uncertainty, and inflation highlighted as the top concerns for businesses.\n\n##### San Francisco\n\nEconomic activity edged down slightly. Employment levels were little changed. Wages grew slightly, and prices rose modestly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreased somewhat while commercial real estate activity was unchanged. Manufacturing and lending activity remained stable. Conditions in consumer and business services were mixed.\n\nNote: This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected on or before October 6, 2025.

              "snippet": "#### While the near-term forecast is revised up modestly, global growth remains subdued, as the newly introduced policies slowly come into focus\n\nThe global economy is adjusting to a landscape reshaped by new policy measures. Some extremes of higher tariffs were tempered, thanks to subsequent deals and resets. But the overall environment remains volatile, and temporary factors that supported activity in the first half of 2025—such as front-loading—are fading.\n\nAs a result, global growth projections in the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) are revised upward relative to the April 2025 WEO but continue to mark a downward revision relative to the pre-policy-shift forecasts. Global growth is projected to slow from 3.3 percent in 2024 to 3.2 percent in 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, with advanced economies growing around 1.5 percent and emerging market and developing economies just above 4 percent. Inflation is projected to continue to decline globally, though with variation across countries: above target in the United States—with risks tilted to the upside—and subdued elsewhere.\n\nRisks are tilted to the downside. Prolonged uncertainty, more protectionism, and labor supply shocks could reduce growth. Fiscal vulnerabilities, potential financial market corrections, and erosion of institutions could threaten stability.\n\nPolicymakers are urged to restore confidence through credible, transparent, and sustainable policies. Trade diplomacy should be paired with macroeconomic adjustment. Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt. Central bank independence should be preserved. Efforts on structural reforms should be redoubled. As Chapter 2 shows, past actions to improve policy frameworks have served countries well. As Chapter 3 demonstrates, industrial policy may have a role, but full consideration should be given to opportunity costs and trade-offs involved in its use.... ###### Chapter 1: Global Prospects and Policies\n\nGlobal growth is projected to slow and growth prospects remain dim, as the world adjusts to a landscape marked by greater protectionism and fragmentation. Global headline inflation is expected to decline further but remain above target in some countries. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Prolonged uncertainty and escalation of protectionist measures may further hinder growth. Larger-than-expected shocks to labor supply could reduce growth, especially in economies facing aging populations and skill shortages. Fiscal vulnerabilities and financial market fragilities may interact with rising borrowing costs and increased rollover risks for sovereigns. An abrupt repricing of tech stocks could threaten macrofinancial stability. Pressure on the independence of key economic institutions could undermine sound economic decision making. To navigate a global economy in flux, policymakers should restore confidence through credible, transparent, and sustainable policies\n\n###### Chapter 2: Emerging Market Resilience: Good Luck or Good Policies?\n\nEmerging markets have shown remarkable resilience to risk-off shocks in recent years. While favorable external conditions—\n\n*good luck*—contributed to this resilience, improvements in policy frameworks— *good policies*—played a critical role in bolstering the capacity of emerging markets to withstand risk-off shocks. Improvements in monetary and fiscal policy implementation and credibility have reduced reliance on foreign exchange interventions, with central banks less sensitive to fiscal interference and holding sway over domestic borrowing conditions. Looking ahead, countries with robust frameworks face easier policy trade-offs and are better positioned to navigate risk-off episodes. In contrast, economies with weaker frameworks risk de-anchoring inflation expectations and larger output losses if monetary tightening is delayed, especially when persistent price pressures emerge. In these settings, costly foreign exchange interventions offer only temporary relief and are less necessary when policy frameworks are sound.... ###### Chapter 3: Industrial Policy: Managing Trade-Offs to Promote Growth and Resilience\n\nCountries are increasingly using industrial policy to reshape their economies by supporting strategic sectors and firms. Motivations include boosting productivity, reducing reliance on imports—especially in energy—and enhancing resilience. Industrial policies can help jump-start domestic industries, but their efficacy is sensitive to sector-specific characteristics that can be hard to determine in advance. And industrial policies present trade-offs. Onshoring production in a strategic sector might lead to higher consumer prices for a prolonged period. And the fiscal cost of industrial policy can be substantial at a time of elevated debt and constrained public finances. Even when sector-level outcomes are positive, industrial policy can generate negative cross-sector spillovers and reduce overall productivity by drawing resources inefficiently away from sectors that are not targeted. Effective industrial policy requires careful targeting and implementation, strong institutions, complementary structural reforms and sound macroeconomic policy.\n\n#### Publications\n\n\n\nJuly 2025\n\n- Global Imbalances in a Shifting World\n\n\n\nRegional Economic Outlooks\n\n- Latest Issues\n\n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\nFinance & Development\n\n- Stablecoins and the Future of Finance",

These include all statistical releases, factsheets and data tables. These dates are determined by availability of the data and are the earliest possible dates which we can publish the information. We publish all our statistics at the standard time of 9.30am.\n\nOur statistical practice is regulated by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). The majority of our statistical releases have been independently reviewed by the OSR and are labelled 'accredited official statistics' (called 'National Statistics' in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007). For more information, see ORR compliance with the Code of Practice.\n\nThe Official Statistics published for Delay compensation claims and Disabled Persons Railcards (DPRC) and assisted journeys data are published on a quarterly basis, however the data relate to railway periods.\n\nIn addition to our Official Statistics, we publish operational data supplied to us from Network Rail on a periodic (4-weekly) basis. These data are made available on our data portal as soon as the data are loaded and validated into our systems. Therefore, it can take up to 15 working days after period end for the tables to be updated.

Interstellar **Comet 3I/ATLAS**(discovered July 2025) will reach perihelion Oct 30, at about 1.4 AU from the Sun [12]. Recent analyses by astronomers (Avi Loeb and others) estimate its nucleus is **>3 miles wide**, with a mass of ~33 billion tons [13]. (Importantly, 3I/ATLAS stays far from Earth – closest approach ~1.8 AU – and will pass behind the Sun, reappearing in December [14] [15].) Two other comets, **SWAN (C/2025 R2)**and **Lemmon (C/2025 A6)**, will brighten in the sky. SWAN reaches its closest Earth approach (~0.26 AU) on Oct 19 but remains very dim without a telescope [16]. Comet **Lemmon**rounds closest to Earth (~0.60 AU) on Oct 21, and forecasts suggest it could brighten to ~magnitude +3 by perihelion on Nov 8. This implies naked-eye visibility under dark skies; Universe Magazine notes that around Oct 21 Lemmon “will be clearly visible even to the naked eye”... ## A Rare October Super Harvest Moon\n\nOctober’s full Moon (Oct 6 local dates) coincides with lunar perigee (closest approach), making it a\n\n**supermoon** – the largest of 2025 [28] [29]. It is also the **Harvest Moon**, by definition the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. However, in 2025 the timing is unusual: unlike most years when the Harvest Moon falls in September, this year it slips into October. *Space.com* explains that “the full moon of Oct. 6… will also carry the title ‘Harvest Moon’” because it actually lies closer to the Sept 23 equinox than September’s full moon [30]. According to *Space.com* expert Joe Rao, “October’s full moon will be the largest and brightest Moon of the year,” and the first supermoon since Nov 2024 [31]. This late Harvest Moon is the latest since 1987 [32].\n\nAstronomers emphasize that the visual effect is subtle: although the Moon will be ~6–14% larger and ~13–30% brighter than average\n\n[33] [34], most people see little actual size change. (The perceived “Moon illusion” makes it look even larger near the horizon [35] [36].) Still, the sight of a bright orange Moon high among the stars is a photogenic treat. Skywatchers in North America will see the Full Moon on the evening of Oct 6, with peak illumination at 11:48 p.m. EDT.... ## Meteor Showers: Draconids & Orionids\n\nOctober brings two named meteor showers, but the real highlight is the Orionids. The\n\n**Draconids** (from Comet 21P/Giacobini–Zinner) peak around Oct 8–9. Unfortunately, this coincides with the super-Harvest Moon, so apart from occasional very bright meteors the shower will largely be washed out by moonlight [37]. National Geographic notes that in 2025 “all but the brightest meteors will likely be drowned out by moonlight” for the Draconids [38]. Despite their low predicted rate (Zenithal Hourly Rate ~5) and the lunar interference, the Draconids are known for erratic outbursts in some years – so it’s still worth a quick look if skies are clear.\n\nThe\n\n**Orionid** meteor shower, by contrast, will be truly unmissable this year. The Orionids — debris from Halley’s Comet — are active Oct 2–Nov 12, but peak activity is expected the night of Oct 21–22 [39] [40]. Crucially, the new Moon on Oct 21 means almost no moonlight during the peak. Both EarthSky and the Planetary Society note that 2025 offers “ideal conditions” for the Orionids. According to the Planetary Society, the Orionids are normally a “medium-low strength shower producing up to 20 meteors per hour from a dark site,” and this year “moonlight will not interfere with observing” thanks to the new Moon [41]. EarthSky concurs: “in 2025, the Orionid meteor shower should rain down its greatest number of meteors on the morning of October 21. The moon won’t interfere.” [42]. Space.com’s Anthony Wood advises skywatchers to “look up on the nights between Oct. 2 to Nov. 12 to see tiny shards of Halley’s Comet strike Earth’s atmosphere” [43], especially around the peak. Under clear, dark skies at peak, observers can reasonably hope to count **10–20 Orionids per hour**, many leaving long glowing trails or occasional fireballs [44] [45]. The best viewing is after midnight, facing Orion’s radiant in the southeast, with patience and a reclining chair to scan the sky.... Meanwhile, two long-period comets discovered earlier in 2025 will be visible in binoculars or better.\n\n**Comet SWAN (C/2025 R2)** was found in SOHO images and passes perihelion Sept 2025. By mid-October it begins appearing in the western evening sky, reaching closest Earth approach (0.26 AU) on Oct 19. However, forecasts indicate SWAN will likely remain rather faint (around 6–7th magnitude), requiring telescopes for casual observers [54].\n\nThe comet most promising to backyard skywatchers is\n\n**C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)**. Discovered Jan 2025 by the Mount Lemmon Survey, it has been steadily brightening. In late September southern observers were already seeing it in binoculars. Lemmon comes closest on Oct 21 (about 0.60 AU from Earth). Current models predict it could reach a visual magnitude of roughly +3 by that time – bright enough to be “clearly visible even to the naked eye” under dark skies [55]. (By November 8, at perihelion, it might brighten further.) As Universe Magazine explains: *“According to current forecasts, [Lemmon’s] brightness at [Oct 21] will reach +3.1, which means it will be clearly visible even to the naked eye”* [56]. Comet Lemmon will move quickly across northern constellations, so charts or apps will help track it; by late October it may appear low in the northwest after sunset. But as comet expert David Levy reminds us, **“comets are like cats: they have tails, and they do precisely what they want.”** [57] Amateur astronomers will be watching closely to see if Lemmon lives up to predictions.... [64] – offering a great opportunity to spot M31 by eye or binoculars. Later in the month the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) climbs high (best around Oct 15) [65]. With the new moon on Oct 21 and crisp autumn air, late October is ideal for binoculars or small telescopes: skywatching guides note that “the nights of Oct 20/21” will be a great chance to combine meteor-hunting with searches for these galaxies and nebulae [66].\n\nFinally, the fall sky brings the familiar W-shape of Cassiopeia and the Perseids’ Double Cluster into early evening view. All October, darker skies and cooler weather mean sharper, steadier viewing. Skywatchers are advised to get away from city lights, dress warmly, and give their eyes time to adapt. As\n\n*Astro Photons* advises, use the new-moon window (Oct 20–23) for deep-sky hunting, but “enjoy the brighter planets and Orionids throughout the month” [67] [68].\n\nOctober 2025 promises a cornucopia of sky sights. Between the Harvest supermoon, dual meteor showers, and multiple comets, there’s plenty for both casual observers and seasoned astronomers to enjoy. The combined insights of professional skywatchers and astrophiles remind us to look up – there are guaranteed\n\n*“epic astronomical events”* to see [69] [70].\n\n**Sources:** National Geographic [71] [72]; Space.com [73] [74]; Planetary Society [75]; *Universum* magazine [76] [77]; EarthSky [78]; NASA science releases [79] [80]; ABC News [81] [82]; local astronomy reporting [83] [84].",

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... 's nearest neighbor, the moon. We start off the month of October finding out that\n{ts:137} the moon is moving on from its waxing phase to a beautiful full phase on Monday, October the 6th. Now, many of\n{ts:146} you have heard of a harvest moon. And what is a harvest moon? It's the full moon that lies closest to the date of\n{ts:153} the autumnal equinox or the beginning of fall. Fall began, as many of you might know, back on September the 21st. So,\n{ts:162} the closest full moon to it would wind up being in early October. So, that date happens to be on the 6th at 11:48 p.m.\n{ts:172} Eastern Daylight Time. So, a quick history of the harvest moon. Why is it called that? In days when we were much\n{ts:179} more of an agricultural society and with crop you know crops being at the plentiful time for harvesting\n{ts:187} the light of the moon the full moon would help farmers to harvest crops. But astronomically this particular full moon\n{ts:194} the harvest moon rises very short shortly that is after sunset. So simple English we find out that this moon would... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

              "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## Filmography\n|Year|Title|Role|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|2018|*Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*|Herself|Contestant; winner|\n|2019|*Mani*|Jade|Main role (season 4)|\n|2020|*The Drew Barrymore Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Tom Green, Tabitha Brown\"|\n|2020|*Polly Pocket*|Herself (voice)|2 episodes|\n|2021|*Attaway General*|Jade|Episode: \"Difference Of Opinion\"|\n|2022|*The Tiny Chef Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Snap Pea Stir Fry\"|\n|2022|*Hell's Kitchen: Battle of the Ages*|Herself|Episode: \"Clawing Their Way to the Top\"|\n|2025|*Sneaks*|Sky (voice)| |\n\n## See also\n- Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n## References",

My mind when I skate is just about having fun and showing my best.\n\n\"I like to skate beautifully and hopefully I can do that and show my dance routine.\"... ### Ad content | Stream Sky Sports on NOW\n\n**Stream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

Sky head coach, Tyler Marsh, told the press that he and his team did not report or witness any misconduct while at Gainbridge Fieldhouse and only learned about the allegations after the game had concluded.

              "snippet": "# From streets to stadiums: Sky Brown, the youngest Olympic Medallist\n\nEmmy Schouten\n\nSky Brown (16) is one of the most talented skateboarders at this years Olympics. After her bronze medal in Tokyo, Sky is hungry for more. We’ll show you her journey to the Paris Olympics!\n\nMulti-talented\n\nSky Brown is half-British half-Japanese! Born in Miyazaki, her original name is Sukai Buraun (スカイ). Her dad Stuart is British, making here eligible to represent the UK on the Olympics. But he moved to the US before she was born. Sky spends half the year in Japan and the other half in the United States for school. She knows how to keep herself busy. If she’s not skateboarding, you can find her surfing, following guitar lessons or doing some jiu jitsu. Especially surfing is one of her big talents. Her original plan was to compete in\n\n*both* skateboarding and surfing at the Paris Olympics. She failed to qualify at the World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico. Despite not hitting her goal, everybody is super proud. And she’ll definitely try again for the 2028 Olympics ;). Her skateboarding career is the most successful yet. Sky started out with some YouTube tutorials and never had a coach. You can find her practicing in Huntington Beach LA. Sometimes she is joined by 3-time gold snowboarding medallist Shaun White who lives just around the corner.... Fun fact: Did you know that know that Sky won\n\n*Dancing with The Stars; Juniors* in 2018? Prizes\n\nAt just 9-years old, Sky participated in the Vans US Open. The youngest ever to do so! One year later, she became a professional skateboarder, again the youngest ever to do so ;). After her professional debut the prizes started coming. Sky won bronze and gold on the World Championships, two gold medals on the X Games, and silver and gold on the Dew Tour. But her best achievement was at the Tokyo Olympics. It was the year skateboarding debuted on the Olympics. Sky immediately took home bronze. At 13 years old, this made her the youngest UK Olympic medallist ever.\n\nA big inspiration\n\nHer skateboarding achievements inspire girls all over the globe. She became an instant role model. With partnerships from Nike, shoe and skate collaborations, Sky created her own brand. People come up to her wearing her helmet or using her skateboard. It pushes her to be the best version of herself everyday. Her message is clear: don’t care what people think. Everybody just has one life and you can’t let anybody stop you from what you want to do. It is her dream to inspire girls. Not even just in skateboarding, but whatever they want to do. This “Sky Brown-effect” is huge in the UK. In the last 5 years, skateboarding in London grew with 800%! A major part of this is girls hitting the streets after Sky’s Olympic performance.... No pressure\n\nEven with all eyes on her, Sky feels no pressure. Skateboarding is all about fun for her. She never sees it as practicing, it is her happy-place. Skating is her “playground”, and this year La Concorde in Paris will be hers. See her in action on August 6!",

              "snippet": "When 13-year-old professional skateboarding and surfing sensation Sky Brown was voted the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in late 2021 – after being Great Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist at the Tokyo Games wining skateboarding park Bronze – she shared an exciting Gold Medal ambition for Paris 2024 that could be transformative for British surfing and skateboarding: “I want to get two Gold Medals in Paris, for Great Britain, in skateboarding and surfing.” Sky is not a person to make empty promises. Taking gold at The World Skate Championships Olympic qualifying event in Sharjah, UA, she is fully aware of her potential.... ## Joining Team GB\n\nBorn in Miyazaki Japan and raised between the USA and Japan, with a British father and Japanese mother, Sky is a young woman of the world. So, it’s a blessing for British actions sports that she has chosen to represent Team GB in her beloved board riding disciplines. With the opportunity to compete for a number of nations, Sky explained how it was “the more relaxed approach of the British Skateboarding Association” that appealed to her free-spirited style. “I begged my parents to let me go with Team GB,” she said. Her dad Stuart added, “We chose Great Britain because we felt that there was no pressure and they didn’t ask us to commit. They made it very clear that if she wasn’t happy or wasn’t feeling good at any time we could pull out.”... ## It runs in the family... Action sports culture runs deep through the Brown family. Sky’s dad Stuart is a long-time surfer and skater. “He built a backyard mini ramp in our place in California,” said Sky, “and skated everyday with his friends, and I would steal his board, which became my favourite toy when I was small.” Sky’s learning curve was remarkable. At age eight she was in the Vans US Open, the youngest skater ever to compete at the event. At 10 she signed a professional contract with Nike, again breaking records as their youngest athlete. And Sky’s skate style oozes with maturity – smooth, flowing, powerful, all with expert timing born in the arcs and angles of surfing. The family normally surf dawn patrols on the Californian coast around Orange County. “Surfing helps with my skating,” says Sky.... “It’s pretty similar, so if the waves are good, I will surf for three to four hours.” She combines home-schooling with two days each week in class, and skates every afternoon - usually at Prince Park in Oceanside or Poods in Encinitas.... ## Dancing with the stars\n\nSky’s fame skyrocketed after winning ‘Dancing with the Stars Juniors’ in 2018 (the US version of ‘Strictly Come Dancing’) - with US teen dancer JT Church. “We didn’t really know what the show was about,” said Stuart (after the show approached the family, having seen Sky’s growing presence in the skateboarding world). “My wife and Sky started watching it on an iPad. I went to bed and when I woke up at 3am they were still watching it! Sky turned to me and said, ‘Daddy, can I do this show?’ She ended up turning down The X Games – something she’d always wanted to do – to do Dancing with the Stars.”... “It was one of the most fun things I’ve ever done because I’m a girly girl and I got to dance and get my hair and makeup done,” said Sky. Dancing on stage transferred to the concrete with rhythm and tempo becoming key features of Sky’s skate park routines.... ## You've got to get back up\n\nDespite her age, she was heading into Tokyo as a medal contender, already the first female to land a frontside 540. Then, while skating on a mega ramp she fell 15 feet and suffered skull fractures (her helmet saving her life) and a broken wrist and hand. Four days later, knowing she would make a full recovery, she wanted to share the experience on social media:... “People might think I'm super girl or something, but I want to show sometimes you're going to fall. I want to spread the message that it's OK to fall sometimes, you are going to fall, all your heroes are going to fall. I wanted to show you've got to get back up and keep on going. Falling is part of life and that can't stop what you're doing. It was heavy for my parents, it was heavy for my family, but it made me stronger.”... ## Skateboarding for everyone\n\n“I think we showed everyone how beautiful skateboarding is. It’s more of a family vibe, and we’re always pushing each other to do more, to go further. I really hope I inspire some girls. Anyone can do skateboarding. You don’t have to be of a certain height or a certain age – you can do it whenever you want. You’ve just got to skate and go for it. I want to make Britain proud as much as I can, and I hope I did. And I want to inspire the world, especially little girls, and teach them that skateboarding is for everyone. I mean, if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.”... ## It's more than just competition\n\nDespite the obvious shared stoke among competitors at the Olympic skate park, what appears to fuel the competitive fire in Sky is the sibling rivalry she has with her younger brother Ocean, also a red hot skater and surfer. “We compete in everything,” affirms Sky. They share a YouTube channel with a huge and growing fanbase. \"I want to push boundaries, keep on improving, and try to close the gender gap as much as I can,” says Sky, who fears losing to her brother above all else. “I have so many dreams, but one now is to go to underprivileged places and teach kids to skate, because I feel like skateboarding – and other sports – helps people who are struggling.”... ## The Olympics\n\nAnd it’s the Olympic torch that remains so important for Sky’s ever-hotter flame. With a cycle of Paris, Los Angeles and Brisbane coming up, Olympic performance could define her career in the way it did for snowboarder and three times Gold Medallist Shaun White. Sky repeats, “My next big dream is to go to the Olympics in Paris 2024 in skateboarding and surfing and hopefully to win two medals for Britain. That would be really cool.”",

              "snippet": "# Scientific Consensus\n\nIt’s important to remember that scientists always focus on the evidence, not on opinions. Scientific evidence continues to show that human activities (primarily the human burning of fossil fuels) have warmed Earth’s surface and its ocean basins, which in turn have continued to impact Earth’s climate. This is based on over a century of scientific evidence forming the structural backbone of today's civilization.\n\nNASA Global Climate Change presents the state of scientific knowledge about climate change while highlighting the role NASA plays in better understanding our home planet. This effort includes citing multiple peer-reviewed studies from research groups across the world,\n\n1 illustrating the accuracy and consensus of research results (in this case, the scientific consensus on climate change) consistent with NASA’s scientific research portfolio.\n\nWith that said, multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals\n\n1 show that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources.... ## American Scientific Societies\n\n### Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations\n\n\"Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.\" (2009)\n\n2\n\n### American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\n\"Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening.\" (2014)\n\n3\n\n### American Chemical Society\n\n\"The Earth’s climate is changing in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and particulate matter in the atmosphere, largely as the result of human activities.\" (2016-2019)\n\n4\n\n### American Geophysical Union\n\n\"Based on extensive scientific evidence, it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. There is no alterative explanation supported by convincing evidence.\" (2019)\n\n5\n\n### American Medical Association\n\n\"Our AMA ... supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.\" (2019)\n\n6\n\n### American Meteorological Society\n\n\"Research has found a human influence on the climate of the past several decades ... The IPCC (2013), USGCRP (2017), and USGCRP (2018) indicate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-twentieth century.\" (2019)\n\n7... ### American Physical Society\n\n\"Earth's changing climate is a critical issue and poses the risk of significant environmental, social and economic disruptions around the globe. While natural sources of climate variability are significant, multiple lines of evidence indicate that human influences have had an increasingly dominant effect on global climate warming observed since the mid-twentieth century.\" (2015)\n\n8\n\n### The Geological Society of America\n\n\"The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2011), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program (Melillo et al., 2014) that global climate has warmed in response to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases ... Human activities (mainly greenhouse-gas emissions) are the dominant cause of the rapid warming since the middle 1900s (IPCC, 2013).\" (2015)\n\n9\n\n## Science Academies\n\n### International Academies: Joint Statement\n\n\"Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001).\" (2005, 11 international science academies)\n\n1 0... ## U.S. Government Agencies\n\n### U.S. Global Change Research Program\n\n\"Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.\" (2018, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies)\n\n12\n\n## Intergovernmental Bodies\n\n### Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\n“It is unequivocal that the increase of CO\n\n2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.\n\n“Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activity on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact.”\n\n1 3-17... ## Other Resources\n\n### List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations\n\nThe following page lists the nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action.\n\nhttp://www.opr.ca.gov/facts/list-of-scientific-organizations.html\n\n### U.S. Agencies\n\nThe following page contains information on what federal agencies are doing to adapt to climate change.\n\nhttps://www.c2es.org/site/assets/uploads/2012/02/climate-change-adaptation-what-federal-agencies-are-doing.pdf\n\n*Technically, a “consensus” is a general agreement of opinion, but the scientific method steers us away from this to an objective framework. In science, facts or observations are explained by a hypothesis (a statement of a possible explanation for some natural phenomenon), which can then be tested and retested until it is refuted (or disproved).*\n\n*As scientists gather more observations, they will build off one explanation and add details to complete the picture. Eventually, a group of hypotheses might be integrated and generalized into a scientific theory, a scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.*... ### References\n\n**1.** K.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... Pacific Coast observers will see the pair of shadows at the onset of morning twilight Oct. 25, the last in this series for the month.\nVenus rises at 5 a.m. local daylight time on Oct. 1, shining at magnitude –3.9 among the stars of Leo. It crosses into Virgo by the 9th and its elongation from the Sun is declining, so it rises later each morning. It's joined by the waning crescent Moon on the 19th; the pair rises around 5:30 a.m. across North America. They stand less than 4° apart, with the Moon just two days from New. Through a telescope, Venus displays a 94-percent-lit disk spanning 11″.\nBy the end of October, the phase expands to 96 percent and the disk shrinks to 10″. On the 31st Venus stands 4° north of Spica, although the magnitude 1.0 star is difficult to see in the brightening sky.\nNote: Moon phases in the calendar vary in size due to the distance from Earth and are shown at 0h Universal Time.

In the south lie the elongated Schiller and the detail-packed Gassendi; the equator sports the small and sharp Kepler, leading north to the outstanding half-ring of the Jura Mountains. Keep going north for some lunar history.... The Orionids' radiant is highest early in the morning. Uranus may be visible to sharp-eyed observers without optical aid. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nComet Search: Watch it move!\nFalling steeply into the Sun's gravity well, Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) drops in from the Oort Cloud for a brief two-month visit. By month's end it peaks around 8th magnitude, comparable to Messier galaxies, in the northwest and is accessible to 3-inch scopes from a country location.\nDiscovered in January by D.C. Fuls with the Mount Lemmon Survey in Arizona, this mile-sized ball of dirt and ice is headed to a point half the Sun-Earth distance before shooting back out.\nSkip October's first two weeks, then get ready to jump. As darkness descends, Comet Lemmon is not much more than 20° high and sinks quickly into the horizon haze. Visual observers should note its position in a star field, then again 30 minutes later to see that it's shifted 1/6 the Moon's apparent diameter. Imagers will be happy with the green glow from carbon emission, but the 11″ displacement for a classic one-minute 'sub' will catch many off guard.

This causes heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, increasing the planet’s surface temperature.\n\nThe panel, which is made up of scientists from around the world, including researchers from B.C., has warned for decades that wildfires and severe weather, such as the province’s deadly heat dome and catastrophic flooding in 2021, would become more frequent and intense because of the climate emergency. It has issued a code red for humanity and warns the window to limit warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial times is closing.\n\nAccording to NASA climate scientists, human activities have raised the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide content by 50 per cent in less than 200 years, and “there is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate.”\n\nAs of Sept. 5, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 425.48 parts per million, down slightly from 427.87 ppm last month, according to NOAA data measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory, a global atmosphere monitoring lab in Hawaii. The NOAA notes there has been a steady rise in CO2 from under 320 ppm in 1960.... ### Climate change quick facts:\n\n• The Earth is now about 1.3 C warmer than it was in the 1800s.\n\n• 2024 was hottest year on record globally, beating the record in 2023.\n\n• The global average temperature in 2023 reached 1.48 C higher than the pre-industrial average, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. In 2024, it breached the 1.5 C threshold at 1.55 C.\n\n• The past 10 years (2015-2024) are the 10 warmest on record.\n\n• Human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by nearly 49 per cent above pre-industrial levels starting in 1850.\n\n• The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change including sea level rise, and more intense drought, heat waves and wildfires.\n\n• On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, the temperature could increase by as much 3.6 C this century, according to the IPCC.\n\n• In June 2025, global concentrations of carbon dioxide exceeded 430 parts per million, a record high.\n\n• Emissions must drop 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C and 2.7 per cent per year to stay below 2 C.\n\n• There is global scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that humans are the cause.\n\n• Scientific information taken from natural sources (such as ice cores, rocks, and tree rings) and from modern equipment (like satellites and instruments) all show the signs of a changing climate.\n\n(Sources for quick facts: United Nations IPCC, World Meteorological Organization, UNEP, NASA, climatedata.ca)... ### UN agency says CO2 levels hit record high last year, causing more extreme weather\n\nHeat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a level not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, the United Nations weather agency said Wednesday.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said in its latest bulletin on greenhouse gases, an annual study released ahead of the U.N.’s annual climate conference, that CO2 growth rates have now tripled since the 1960s, and reached levels that existed more than 800,000 years ago.\n\nEmissions from burning coal, oil and gas, alongside more wildfires, have helped fan a “vicious climate cycle,” as people and industries continue to spew heat-trapping gases while the planet’s oceans and forests lose their ability to absorb them, the WMO report said.\n\nThe Geneva-based agency said the increase in the global average concentration of carbon dioxide from 2023 to 2024 amounted to the highest annual level of any one-year span since measurements began in 1957. Growth rates of CO2 have accelerated from an annual average increase of 2.4 parts per million per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020, to 3.5 ppm from 2023 to 2024, it said.\n\n“The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbocharging our climate and leading to more extreme weather,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett in a statement. “Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being.”\n\n*—The Associated Press*... ### ‘I’m the same me’: Canada’s Mark Carney defends his climate record\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he’s focused on climate policies that are likely to have the greatest impact at a time of strained resources and multiple crises, denying criticisms that he’s back pedalling on actions to protect the environment.\n\n“What we need to do is to be as effective as possible, in terms of addressing climate change while growing our economy,” he said during a podcast interview for Bloomberg Weekend’s The Mishal Husain Show.\n\nDespite deep green credentials — including a five-year stint as United Nations special envoy for climate change — Carney has scrapped a number of environmental policies introduced by his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and struck a notably friendlier tone on fossil fuel production. He’s fast-tracked approval for a liquefied natural gas export facility expansion in B.C., opened the door to the possibility of a new oil pipeline to the country’s West Coast, and hasn’t ruled out abandoning plans for an emissions cap for oil and gas producers.\n\nPressed on his plans for the cap, Carney repeatedly responded that “a desired outcome” — in this case emissions reduction — “is not a policy.”\n\n“What makes those emissions go down will be carbon capture and storage,” he said. The former central banker has previously said carbon capture could be part of a “grand bargain” with the province of Alberta that would allow it to increase its fossil fuel exports via a new oil pipeline.\n\n*—Bloomberg News*... ### Southern resident killer whales show signs of slow decline toward disappearance\n\nThe latest survey of endangered southern resident killer whales confirms their plateau and gradual slide toward disappearance in the absence of stronger measures to protect them, a director with the U.S.-based Center for Whale Research says.\n\nMichael Weiss says declining chinook populations, pollutants and noise from ships in the orcas’ habitat off the coast of Washington State and southern B.C. are among the factors driving the decline.\n\n“We’re not talking about southern residents going extinct in the next five years, but we are talking about a fairly good chance of at least one of the (three) pods being gone within the next 50 years,” Weiss said.\n\nThe long-term work of restoring chinook habitat, particularly freshwater spawning grounds, along with adjusting fisheries, would be key to the orcas’ recovery, says Weiss.\n\nHis remarks come with the release on Monday of an annual survey by the organization based in Washington State, offering a snapshot of the population of southern residents as of July 1. This year’s survey found the overall population was 74, up by one from last year.\n\nDuring the census period, researchers documented four births among all three distinct pods of southern residents, but only two calves survived, it says.\n\n*—The Canadian Press*... ### The world is heading to add 57 super hot days a year, but study indicates it could have been worse\n\nThe world is on track to add nearly two months of dangerous super hot days each year by the end of the century, with poorer small nations hit far more often than the biggest carbon-polluting countries, a study released Thursday found.\n\nBut efforts to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that started 10 years ago with the Paris climate agreement have had a significant effect. Without them Earth would be heading to an additional 114 days a year of those deadly extra hot days, the same study found.\n\nThe international collection of climate scientists World Weather Attribution and the U.S.-based Climate Central teamed up to use computer simulations to calculate just how much of a difference the landmark accord has made in terms of one of the biggest climate effects on people: heat waves.\n\nThe report — which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution — calculated how many super hot days the world and more than 200 countries got in 2015, how many Earth gets now and what’s projected in two future scenarios.\n\nOne scenario is if countries fulfil their promises to curb emissions and by the year 2100 the world warms 2.6 C above preindustrial times. That adds 57 super hot days to what Earth gets now, according to the study. The other scenario is the 4 C of warming that the world had been on track to hit before the Paris agreement. The study found that would double the number of additional hot days.\n\n*—The Associated Press*",

              "snippet": "**PROVIDENCE, R.I.** [Brown University] — People who dispute scientific consensus on topics such as vaccine efficacy, climate change or the Big Bang tend to overestimate their own knowledge of these subjects, a new study has shown.\n\nThe study, led by scholars at Brown University, Portland State University and the University of Colorado Boulder, surveyed thousands of Americans online, quizzing them on scientific facts and soliciting their opinions on eight contested topics, including the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe scholars found that respondents who answered more factual questions correctly were more likely to agree with the scientific consensus about each topic. On the other hand, those who answered many factual questions incorrectly but thought they understood certain topics well were more likely to disagree with the scientific consensus. For example, many who said in July 2020 that they would “definitely not get the vaccine” incorrectly answered questions about how viruses spread and how vaccines work, but then said they thought they had a “thorough understanding” of how a COVID-19 vaccine would work.\n\nThe research was published in Science Advances.\n\nSteven Sloman, a co-author of the study and a professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown, said the findings demonstrate that whether or not people agree with scientists doesn’t just depend on how well they understand the science — it also depends on how well they perceive their own understanding. The research also shows the extent to which alternative facts have taken hold in many communities.... “It is a sad fact that our society has returned to an era in which many people’s sense of what’s true is governed more by the beliefs of the people around them than by the hard work of scientists using evidence to test their hypotheses,” Sloman said.\n\nNick Light, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of marketing at Portland State University, said the study reveals why fact-based educational interventions have had only limited success in convincing people to, say, get vaccinated or reduce their individual carbon footprints.\n\n“For many years, smart people thought that the way to bring people more in line with scientific consensus was to teach them the knowledge they lacked,” Light said. “Unfortunately, our research suggests that there may be a problem of overconfidence getting in the way of learning… If people think they know a lot, they have minimal motivation to learn more.”",

As a result, \nshutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is likely within the next 20-30 \nyears, unless actions are taken to reduce global warming – in contradiction to conclusions of IPCC. If \nAMOC is allowed to shut down, it will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several meters – \nthus, we describe AMOC shutdown as the “point of no return.”\nWe suggest that an alternative perspective – a complement to the IPCC approach – is needed to assess \nthese issues and actions that are needed to avoid handing young people a dire situation that is out of their \ncontrol. This alternative approach will make more use of ongoing observations to drive modeling and \nmore use of paleoclimate to test modeling and test our understanding.

Multiple runs of a GCM \n(global climate model) with this aerosol forcing produced maximum global cooling afer the volcano of 0.3 °C and \na maximum decrease of Earth’s energy balance of 3 W/m2 (Figure 5) consistent with ERBE satellite observations.14...

Later estimates (NASA and USask)16,17 \nbased on satellite data bracket the estimate based on Pinatubo but have earlier peak opacity, likely due to the higher \nlatitude of the Hunga eruption, which placed the aerosols closer to where they descend from the stratosphere.\nFigure S3.

              "snippet": "# What's in the sky October 2025\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nWelcome to your October guide to the Southern Hemisphere night sky! This month, we’ve got a fantastic mix of planets, deep sky objects, and even a rare comet to chase. Whether you’re a casual stargazer enjoying the view with binoculars, a telescope enthusiast hunting planets and nebulae, or an astrophotographer capturing the wonders above, there’s plenty to see and explore. From bright planets like Saturn and Mercury to stunning deep sky gems like the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Helix Nebula, October promises plenty of celestial highlights to keep your nights busy.\n\n**Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN**\n\nThis month brings a rare visitor from the outer Solar System: Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, which reaches its closest approach on October 19th, just 0.261 AU from Earth. Last seen in the inner Solar System over 20,000 years ago.\n\nImage Credit: Mike Kane\n\nAfter perihelion on September 12, it developed a striking 5° corkscrew-shaped ion tail visible in photographs. That’s about the length of 10 Full Moons! Currently around magnitude 6, it’s visible with binoculars low on the western horizon just after sunset. Look near Mars and Spica in Virgo to help spot it. As it approaches Earth, it may brighten to magnitude 4, possibly making it visible to the naked eye under dark skies.. This closest approach is due to happen on the 19... th of October, so pencil in the days between the 18 th till the 21 st, as that will hopefully be one of the best opportunities this year to observe a comet. The comet will continue moving through Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius before fading in early November.\n\nAnd since comets can surprise us with sudden changes in brightness or appearance, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN. Look out for an updated video and article from us right before the best viewing nights so you’ll know exactly what to expect and how to spot it.\n\n**Mercury**\n\nThis month, we’ve also got the 2\n\nnd best opportunity of the year to observe Mercury, as it reaches its greatest elongation on the 29 th of October. This is when Mercury reaches it’s greatest distance in the sky from the Sun and makes it the best time to observe the planet.\n\nThe greatest elongation of the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is kind of like their version of opposition. It’s not quite the same, as it’s not when the planet is at it’s largest, but it represents the best opportunity to observe the planet, as it signifies when the planet appears to be the farthest distance form the sun in our sky.... If you don’t have an opportunity to observe on exactly the 29\n\nth, don’t worry! While planetary opposition and elongation events are typically given as just one date, the truth is that while this date represents the absolute peak, observing up to a week before or after is often 90% as good! So don’t think you’ve missed out, you haven’t!\n\n**Saturn**\n\nSpeaking of opposition, while Saturn’s opposition has already passed, secretly we actually think now may be a better time to observe. Why? Because while Saturn is ever so slightly smaller than last month, it’s rising earlier in the night, making it easier to observe for those of us keen to maintain a reasonable bedtime!\n\nWhile the best viewing window is still a little late, between 10 and 12pm, you’ll still get great views of the planet anytime after sunset, and Saturn should be fairly easy to spot in the Northeastern area of the sky.\n\n**Neptune**\n\nOnce again Neptune joins us alongside Saturn in the Sky. If you’ve got a scope big enough (we’d typically recommend and aperture of 6 inches or larger), and you can See Saturn in the sky, then you’ll be able to spot Neptune. There’s not much worth looking at in it’s own right, but if you’re already observing Saturn, you may as well turn your scope to the furthest planet in the Solar system.... Like Saturn, Neptune is best observed between 10-12pm, but you’ll be able to see it anytime after sunset.\n\nIf you’re up late, this month also represents a good time to have a look at Uranus. Again if you’ve got the aperture, you’ll see a tiny grey-blue disk. This month it’s really only for the most dedicated planet hunters, as to have a good view of it, you’ll need to be up between 1-3am, as that’s when it’s best positioned for observing in the sky.... ###\n\n**Uranus**\n\n**Deep Sky Objects This Month**\n\n**The Small Magellanic Cloud/SMC (NGC 292)**\n\nThe main attraction this month is one of the gems of the Southern sky, The Small Magellanic cloud. While it doesn’t take up as much of the sky as it’s cousin the Large Magellanic cloud (more on this incredible object come January), there’s nothing Small about this cloud of stars, as it stretches 4 degrees across in the sky (that’s 8 moons across!).\n\nImage Credit: ESO/VISTA VMC\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud, or SMC for short is a satellite galaxy of the Milkyway, meaning the SMC orbits the Milky way much in a similar way to how the Moon orbits the Earth! It’s exclusively visible to us in the southern hemisphere, and is easily one of the gems of the southern sky.\n\nThe SMC is visible to the naked eye from dark sites with little light pollution, and in fact is one of the furthest objects visible with the naked eye, at a distance of 200,000 light years away. Up the magnification and light gathering with a pair of Binoculars and the SMC will stand out even more, and you’ll also be able to make out some of the details of the galaxy itself. Up the Magnification and light gathering even more with a large telescope, and individual features within the SMC become resolvable.... Another great target this month is NGC 7293, the Helix Nebula. Often also known by the much more dramatic name, the Eye of God Nebula, the Helix Nebula is one of the closest Planetary Nebula to Earth, which makes it one of the rare planetary Nebula in the sky large enough to make out considerable detail through a telescope, as well as being large enough to be a great target astrophotography target for small refractors and Smart telescopes.\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nThrough the eyepiece, you’ll see an eye shape staring right back, and you’ll see more details the darker your sky, and if you have a UHC filter like this one to boost contrast: https://bintel.com.au/products/astronomik-uhc-filter.\n\nPlanetary nebulae like the Helix are formed during the final stages of a medium-sized star’s life. When stars similar in size to our Sun exhaust the fuel in their cores, they shed their outer layers into space, creating an expanding shell of glowing gas. The exposed hot core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation that excites the surrounding gas, causing it to shine in the striking colours we see in photographs. Planetary nebulae aren’t uncommon in the galaxy, but the Helix is special because it’s one of the closest and brightest, making its structure and details much easier to observe.... The Helix Nebula is another quintessentially Southern object. While it is technically observable from the Northern Hemisphere, they don’t get to see it quite like we do, as we get to see it rise right overhead in the night sky.\n\nYou’ll find the Helix nebula in the constellation Aquarius, and it’s best observed between 8 to 10pm, when its at its highest in the night sky.\n\nAnd that brings an end to this month’s guide to the night sky. October offers an incredible variety of observing opportunities for Southern Hemisphere stargazers. From the bright planets like Saturn, Mercury, and Neptune, to a rare visitor from the outer Solar System in Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, there’s something for every type of observer, no matter if you’re up late hunting faint outer planets or enjoying a relaxed evening spotting a comet low on the horizon. The deep sky is equally rewarding, with the Small Magellanic Cloud and its internal treasures like NGC 346, as well as the Helix Nebula, giving both visual observers and astrophotographers stunning targets to explore. With clear skies, dark horizons, and a mix of familiar and extraordinary objects, October is shaping up to be a month that truly showcases the richness of our southern night sky.",

NASA his­\ntory is important as a way to help understand the \ntechnological and societal implications of the space \nage. Furthermore, in looking at NASA’s use of out­\nside scientific advice, we seek to understand what \ngood has come from it, whether it has had signifi­\ncant impacts, and if so, in what ways. The answers \nto such questions, of course, address the question \nof when NASA should seek outside advice. We ask \nhow well has the advisory process worked, what \nefforts worked well, what fell flat, and why? Are \nthere common attributes or recurring themes that \nhelp distinguish between effective efforts and run-\nof-the-mill communications? What are the distinc­\ntions between different sources of outside advice \nand are those distinctions relevant and important? \nFinally, given past experiences and trends, can one \ncount on the process working as well in the future, \nor are there obstacles to be anticipated and over­\ncome?

Part 1 briefly examines early forerunner \nactivities at NACA and in the decade leading up \nto NASA’s formation; it then considers NASA’s use \nof outside advice during its first three decades. Part \n2 picks up the story in 1988 and follows it up to \n2016. Part 3 examines a sampling of case studies, \ndiscusses recurring characteristics of notably suc­\ncessful advisory activities, and provides a glimpse \nof what past experience might imply for the future \nof scientific advice at NASA. The last two chap­\nters provide big-picture summaries of themes that \nhave emerged from earlier discussions.

The first — archival research — drew on... vii\nPreface\nformal process apart from the broader questions of \ngathering scientific advice. Nevertheless, many of \nthe attributes that make other advice effective will \napply to peer reviews as well.\nAlso for the sake of keeping the discussion \nfocused, the book looks mainly at scientific advi­\nsory committees established by NASA (deemed \ninternal committees) and bodies established by \nthe National Research Council (deemed external \ncommittees), especially the Space Science Board, \nits successor the Space Studies Board (SSB), and \ntheir cousins, the Space Applications Board and \nthe Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board. \nSeveral other NRC boards — notably the Board \non Physics and Astronomy, the Board on Atmo­\nspheric Sciences and Climate, the Board on Earth \nSciences and Resources, and the Board on Life Sci­\nences — have organized important advisory studies \nfor NASA. While the monograph’s discussions do \nnot ignore those bodies, the work of the SSB has \nbeen sufficiently extensive that the lessons from \nthe SSB-NASA experience should be more broadly \napplicable to the rest of the NRC in terms of advice \non NASA space and Earth science. \nFinally, there have been other entities besides \nNASA’s formally established internal committees \nand separate groups operating under the aegis of \nthe National Research Council that have provided \nadvice from time to time about the Agency’s sci­\nence programs. Examples include the National \nAcademy of Public Administration, scientific \nsocieties such as the American Astronomical Soci­\nety and the American Geophysical Union, public \ninterest groups such as The Planetary Society, and \na few “blue-ribbon” committees commissioned by \nthe government. The advisory roles of these bodies \nand their cousins have been rather more ad hoc \nand much less ubiquitous than the NASA and \nNRC committees. Given that lessons from the \nlarge body of experience with the latter are quite \nlikely to be relevant to the former, the monograph \nwill not dig into the history of scientific advice \nfrom groups other than those formed by NASA \nand the NRC.... nautics for four decades starting in the 1920s, and \nhe later collaborated with Wernher Von Braun in \ndeveloping the German V-2 rocket.

              "url": "https://www.astronomy.com/observing/october-2025-whats-in-the-southern-hemisphere-sky-this-month/",
              "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude. Located inside the border are the cardinal directions and their intermediate points. To find stars, hold the map overhead and orient it so one of the labels matches the direction you’re facing. The stars above the map’s horizon now match what’s in the sky.\n\nThe all-sky map shows how the sky looks at:\n\n10 p.m. October 1\n\n9 p.m. October 15\n\n8 p.m. October 31\n\nPlanets are shown at midmonthOctober2025-SouthernHemisphereDownload",

'm not done yet by the way i'm not done i do hope that you'll continue to watch this into the webinar it's a long video i recommend you take chunks of it at a time it's a lot it's kind of mind-bending information uh it's\ninformation people are not aware of they have not heard of they're completely like \"Wait what are you saying that's not what I was taught that's not what I've learned.\" Um it's like \"Yeah I know welcome to my world.\" So I want to start with this um there's a few truth bombs there's a few uh uh narratives I'... confronted a chemtrail pilot a cloud seating yes absolutely um cloud seating is generally happens with a Cessna airplane and they're using flares to essentially put out silver iodide and many times there's also a type of chaff that is included in this and this is so that they can through satellite actually trace where the the silver iodide is going to see if they actually hit their mark this is highly highly t targeted and highly highly {ts:794680} localized it is not the crisscrosses in in the sky whatsoever so there's a massive confusion around that and that is doing a disservice because it's making people believe that this individual confronted a chemtrail pilot therefore those streaks in the skies are chemtrails and we're being misdirected is what I can say is we're being misdirected from once again two years of research evidence legal team legal researchers meteorologists citizen uh researchers and through their research and efforts they have proven to me the current beliefs around geoengineering and its narrative are completely incorrect and I know I might sound a little mysterious to some of you that's why you've got to watch uh the our webinar from last night so there's that so that has to be clarified um nobody has ever confronted uh a chemtrail pilot um after you know watching flight radar and jumping in their car that has yet to to happen it... 's cloud seating cloud seating is with Cessna's thousand feet up so that need to be clarified big time now there's something else that I have to speak to and this is really really huge um essentially there has been a story continuously circulating that is once again incorrect and that has to do with uh gag orders there has been a story put out there and continues to be put out there that weather reporters meteorologists have been officially told by the government to shut up around identifying any kind of um weather modification weather manipulation programs going on and this\nhas been circulating as the answer to when people ask why don't we know about geoengineering why don't we know about these programs well it's because there's a gag order i thought this was true so two years ago our legal team from Houston Texas we were pursuing this as a first amendment violation by the federal government and it was our job to go out there and most importantly to find the original source document of that gag order from the federal government telling meteorologists and weather reporters not to talk about weather modification programs and what we {ts:929920} understood ultimately and found out because we heard from the actual attorneys who could provide that source document and essentially this is what they had to say this actually comes from the legal council of of what is known as the peer organization the public employees for environmental responsibility and what we found out is that there was no source document putting a gag order on weather reporters and meteorologists this gag order was actually about union negotiation and this was a confidentiality agreement during the negotiation uh that that they could not discuss what was going on behind the scenes during their collective bargaining agreement and Richard Hearn who is the general counsel of the peer organization as well as executive director let us know that there 100% unequivocally is no gag order has never been a gag order on any weather reporters or or meteorologists now again you might start calling me a shill or a CIA agent or something very exciting like And I just want to say all you need to... 've been applying that to our research and our legal work but the average person does not know that and when you say to them hey it's this not that they go oh no you're wrong these engines do not create condensation trails that's absolutely 100% false information why is it important for you to know this because it's leading us down the wrong trail and as we were discussing last night I think what's happened whether it was by design or inadvertently we have this big bad boogeyman out there uh as Jim Lee says it's the straw man and we're told to look way out there for the big bad boogeyman and I guarantee you there's clandestine programs so this is by the way what what we're speaking to is not\nmutually exclusive it's not one or the other it can still be both but the point is this is while we're out there looking for the needle in the haststack which are the clandestine programs we actually have commercial aviation which are now up to 43 million flights over our heads that have jet exhaust that we see that is spewing over us whether you see the condensation trails or not day in day out day in day out and that number is rising exponentially now what's important to this as well is that when we had the individual confronting the chemtrail pilot this individual was stating that her rainwater results showed essentially I guess um chemtrails proof chemtrails mind you she was speaking to a a uh cloud seating pilot and those rainwater {ts:1203919} samples do not reflect cloud seating they do not reflect chemtrails in the way that we think they are those rainwater samples reflect commercial aviation exhaust this actually is what is coming from the exhaust of the jet fuel itself and I know this for a fact why because we Save Our Skies paid for eight of those those very specific rainwater samples from this individual we paid for eight of them for Save Our Skies for illegal pursuit and we paid for them and we saw the results and they reflected jet exhaust nothing else jet exhaust so again that that narrative has to be corrected it... 's misrepresentative of what's really going on and the high bypass turbo fan engines is also misrepresentative of what's really going on and I think what's happened here is that we have been led to look for that needle in the haystack thinking that that is going to if we if we stop it it's you know and get it out of there it's going to bring back the blue skies but it's actually the hay stack that's the problem it's right it's right in front\nof us it's it's it's we don't need to look for the needle it's it's the haystack itself and what is the haystack commercial aviation and people have a hard hard time hearing that why because for years now for years now they've been convinced by certain other individuals who have been scaring the Jesus out of us telling us it's these clandestine programs and again I'm not saying these are not clandestine programs going on america has a history of clandestine programs well doumented this is not an eitheror it's not one or the other my job the job of our Saver Skies team and all the consultants and all the researchers who have been assisting us and holding our hand and and opening our eyes it's been our job to get down to what is real why because we want to be effective so ultimately and we'll get into this when all the geoengineering {ts:1336799} legislation started passing in the states it... 're seeing and know what they're not seeing and be able to delineate between myth and fact and our objective is so that you can look up and go okay this is the day we should be seeing streaks in the sky persistent contrails or this is the day we should\nnot be seeing them whatsoever what is that why am I seeing a persistent contrail and guess what bingo Eureka you are actually uncovering a geoengineering clandestine program right so if the conditions are such where you should not be seeing it and you're like wait a second what is that you've just probably found that needle in the hay stack that is what we've been trying to teach people to do so you know what to expect and when something's unusual it'll pop out at you and we've been teaching that and that has been also through the most accurate narrative the most fact-based and scientifically based information that we have at our hands and to then have individuals continuously go out there repeat the false narrative that there's a gag order that's why you don't know about these clandestine programs that's that are happening everywhere uh and and to continue the false narrative that these high bypass turboan engines uh do not create persistent contrails absolutely uh it is actually covering and clouding {ts:1589360} the truth and then to have the belief that you can use flight radar and track down chemtrail pilots and put them in their place is absolutely also in inaccurate and doing an extraordinary disservice to our fight and to winning and I",

Precious people, there is a\n{ts:4} fake message being spread online. Some claiming that the mightest prophet of the Lord has said that the world will\n{ts:10} end on the 2nd of August. Uh let me say this clearly and without hesitation. That is a lie. It is false and it is not\n{ts:19} from the prophet. [Music] [Music]\n{ts:39} Now what the prophet has always preached if you have followed this ministry even briefly if you have followed the\n{ts:46} ministry of repentance and holiness the ministry of the mightiest prophet of the lord you already know that the that what\n{ts:52} prophet waras never given is a spec a specific date. He has never given a specific date for the end of the\n{ts:60} world or the rapture. In fact, he has consistently and publicly preached that no one knows the day, the hour,\n{ts:69} just as the Lord Jesus said uh in the book of Matthew 24:36. Again, I think I should quote that. The\n{ts:76} book of Matthew 24:36 the Bible says uh but about that day or hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the... {ts:175} that the servants of the Lord have gone to. Even here in Australia, the servant of\n{ts:181} God has always proclaimed the message, the same message, the message of prepare the way the Messiah is coming and the\n{ts:190} need to turn away from sin and live a right and live in righteousness because uh the coming of the Lord is\n{ts:196} very very near precious people and uh never has he ever said that the world will end on this particular date. Not\n{ts:204} now. Be always on the guard. Be always watchful.\n{ts:217} Be always prepared. [Music] Be ready all the time\n{ts:225} and looking up all the time because nobody knows the day or the hour.\n{ts:231} [Music] and pray that you may be able to escape what is about to happen to the whole\n{ts:236} earth. That's a deliberate prayer direct. Now the source and motive behind the lie\n{ts:251} probably someone might ask himself what's the source and the motive behind this line? So where did this rumor come\n{ts:256} from? Now now let's let's be honest here. This we definitely know that this is the work of um money lovers,... {ts:265} attention seekers, people hungry for views, um clicks and online traffic. Um they know the name of the prophet draws\n{ts:276} attention. So they attempt to drag it into lies to boost their platforms. They're very sad\n{ts:284} to drag the name of the servant of the lord into their lies just so so that they may just boost the traffic. You\n{ts:292} know they don't even have the the evidence that the servant of the lord spoke said that others create fake\n{ts:298} headlines or posts just to sty controversies. It's about algorithms and you know ad revenue money. But how\n{ts:307} tragic, how tragic and how sad to use the fear of the end times to drive engagement.\n{ts:315} How sad to manipulate sacred matters for personal gain. How sad. The Bible warns in the book of Galatians 6:7 that do not\n{ts:325} be deceived. God is not mocked. Whatever a man sws that will also reap. He will also reap that. And actually the the the\n{ts:336} ministry official pages um for example on Facebook has come out to to really set the record straight that there is... {ts:344} nothing like that that the servant of the Lord had ever said. Now this is not a game. These are people's soul that\n{ts:353} someone is busy playing with. You know to those pushing this lie. My address will be just please repent.\n{ts:361} you know uh and try to use the chance the time that you have to turn back to God because you know every idle word\n{ts:370} will be brought into judgment every idol word will be brought into judgment that day and that day is very very coming. So\n{ts:377} let's set the the the record straight. Let's set the record straight that um here is what the prophet has actually\n{ts:383} stood for and has actually said over and over again. There is a day that is coming\n{ts:393} and that day when it arrives it will change the earth total totally.\n{ts:407} It will be irretrievable, irreversible, irrevable. [Music]\n{ts:421} He's saying that there is a day that is coming\n{ts:430} when the Lord as we are going to see now in the scripture\n{ts:436} when the Lord himself will come down to take the church. We are going to see in the scripture... {ts:443} just now. Now this is a message probably to us those\n{ts:451} who are believers are Christians. How should we respond then? Number one, we don't need to share rumors. We don't\n{ts:459} need to forward lies. Don't be part of spreading and and spreading confusion. You know, if it doesn't match the\n{ts:466} scripture or the voice of the Lord's true servant, reject it. Reject it. We have to stand, you know,\n{ts:475} we have to uh to to to to speak the truth. If someone tells you that the prophet has said that the world is\n{ts:482} ending on a particular day, we have to be firm and respond, you know, gently but firm and debunk this\n{ts:491} this lies, you know. Now, we need to focus on our personal preparation. The issue is not the date. Actually, the\n{ts:498} issue is your soul. Are you ready? That's the should be the question. Are you ready? Uh today, for\n{ts:506} example, if the Lord were to come, are you ready? We know you devil, the devil has been... {ts:513} using the same same tactics to dissuade people and to lie to many people and busy leading them to hell. The enemy\n{ts:520} knows that his time is short, very short. and uh and and and and that's why you know lies you know uh lies like this\n{ts:530} are being spread uh and manufactured people hellbent to create lies lies like this to taint the name of the\n{ts:542} ministry of the Lord you know they're busy mocking God's word you know discrediting every word that is in the\n{ts:550} Bible and try to distract the church That is the goal. They're trying to distract the church. But let me say\n{ts:556} again, God cannot be mocked. The Lord will defend his own word. [Music]\n{ts:574} [Music]",

              "snippet": "The story broke while Donald Trump's presidential campaign was in full swing, and journalist Rob Crilly noted that at that time he \"has had more weighty facts to clarify, such as his claim that Muslims in New Jersey cheered on the day of the 9/11 attacks – an old rumour that has long been discredited – and his latest boast, that he watched people jumping to their deaths from the Twin Towers from his Manhattan flat, four miles [6 km] away\". According to Jack Holmes of *Esquire* magazine, the ahistorical marker is symptomatic of the Trump administration; Jack Holmes points at other historical blunders made by members of the Trump administration, including Kellyanne Conway's reference to the non-existent Bowling Green massacre and Sean Spicer's claim that even Hitler had not used chemical weapons in conventional warfare, although Zyklon-B was used to exterminate prisoners in the Holocaust.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed he is an 18-time club championship winner at several clubs, none of which can be positively confirmed, and 16 of which were not official or all-member club championships. All these wins have been recorded at golf clubs owned or managed by The Trump Organization. Professional and amateur golfers, such as Buddy Marucci, have claimed that Trump would threaten to revoke the membership of anyone who won against him, thus allowing him to win club championships with little competition. Trump has claimed to have won the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach Club Championship in 1999, before the club was officially opened to membership, and the 2023 Senior Club Championship at the same course, despite not being present for the first day.... Trump at Naval Station Norfolk Pier 14, Norfolk, VirginiaOctober 5, 2025\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump falsely claimed to have predicted the attacks in his 2000 book *The America We Deserve* (ghostwritten by Dave Shiflett), that Osama bin Laden was not well known when the book was published, and that it called for the U.S. to \"take him out\". The book does contain two separate passages that mention bin Laden (who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list since June 7, 1999) and suggest an incident worse than the 1993 World Trade Center bombing may occur, but it does not call for the preemptive killing of bin Laden nor suggest he would be the one to orchestrate such an event if not killed. The ghostwriter, Shiflett, has called *The America We Deserve* \"[his] first work of fiction\".\n\nDuring his second presidency on October 5, 2025, Trump reiterated the falsehood at an event in Norfolk, Virginia celebrating the upcoming 250th anniversary of the US Navy's founding (October 13). Bringing up the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden under the Obama administration, Trump subsequently claimed to have warned his incumbent Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of bin Laden's activity before the September 11th attacks in 2000 (or erroneously in 2024). In 2000, 19-year-old Hegseth enrolled at Princeton University, most likely never meeting Trump during his enrollment. Hegseth would not become the United States Secretary of Defense until January 25, 2025 at age 44, over two decades after the attack and less than ten months before Trump made this version of the false claim.... Trump claimed that his father had given him \"a small loan of a million dollars\", which he used to build \"a company that's worth more than $10 billion\", denying Marco Rubio's allegation that he had inherited $200 million. A 2018 *New York Times* exposé on Fred and Donald Trump's finances concludes that Donald \"was a millionaire by age 8\", and that he had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime, including over $60 million ($140 million in 2018 currency) in loans, which were largely unreimbursed.\n\nTrump claimed repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2015 that the actual unemployment rate of around 5% \"isn't reflective [of reality] ... I've seen numbers of 24%, I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment\". PolitiFact rated this claim \"Pants on Fire\", its rating for the most egregious falsehoods. Jeremy Adam Smith, writing for the *Greater Good Magazine*, said Trump's falsehoods may be \"blue lies\", which are \"told on behalf of a group, that can actually strengthen the bonds among the members of that group\". As a result, he posited, Trump's dishonesty does not lose the support of his political base, even while it \"infuriates and confuses almost everyone else\".... By October 9, 2019, *The Washington Post*'s fact-checking team documented that Trump had \"made 13,435 false or misleading claims over 993 days\". On October 18, 2019, the *Washington Post* Fact Checker newsletter described the situation:\n\nA thousand days of Trump. We often hear from readers wondering how President Trump's penchant for falsehoods stacks up in comparison to previous presidents. But there is no comparison: Trump exists in a league of his own. Deception, misdirection, gaslighting, revisionism, absurd boasts, and in some cases, provable lies, are core to his politics.\n\nAfter departing the White House, January 20, 2021, Trump gave a farewell address at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland prior to departing on Air Force One for his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. The AP fact-checked his speech, and reported that it included false statements about his presidency and administration's accomplishments. These included statements that he passed the largest tax cuts in history; that the U.S. economy during his tenure was the greatest in U.S. history; that he achieved record job creation; that his administration rebuilt both the U.S. military and the American manufacturing industry; that he destroyed the ISIS caliphate; and a reiteration of his previously repeated falsehood that he, and not former President Barack Obama, had passed the Veterans Choice Act. These falsehoods added to the 30,573 falsehoods that *The Washington Post*'s fact-checker had tallied by the end of Trump's presidency, an average of 21 falsehoods a day.\n\nScholarly analysis of Trump's tweets found \"significant evidence\" of an intent to deceive:\n\nAnalyzing Trump's tweets with a regression function designed to predict true and false claims based on their language and composition, it finds significant evidence of intent underlying most of Trump's false claims, and makes the case for calling them lies when that outcome agrees with the results of traditional fact-checking procedures.... We argue, based on our findings here, that intent to deceive is a reasonable inference from most of Trump's false tweets, and that drawing that conclusion when the evidence warrants could help scholars and journalists alike better explain the strategic functions of political falsehoods.... ### Commentary and analysis\n\nAs president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks. Trump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office according to *The New York Times*, and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of *The Washington Post*. By the *Post*'s tally, it took Trump 601 days to reach 5,000 false or misleading statements and another 226 days to reach the 10,000 mark. For the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections, it rose to an average of 30 per day from 4.9 during his first 100 days in office. The *Post* found that Trump averaged 15 false statements per day during 2018.\n\nThe *New York Times* editorial board frequently lambasted Trump's dishonesty. In September 2018, the board called him \"a president with no clear relation to the truth\". The following month, the board published an opinion piece titled, \"Donald Trump Is Lyin' Up a Storm\".\n\nJames Comey had frequent discussions with Trump, and in his first major interview after his firing he described Trump as a serial liar who tells \"baffling, unnecessary\" falsehoods:... #### Denial of collusion with Russia\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed he and his campaign did not collude with Russia, and Republicans and many otherwise reliable sources have repeated that false claim even though Mueller said that he did not investigate \"collusion\", only \"conspiracy\" and \"coordination\". The claim that there was no collusion has been described as a myth.\n\nIn a January 2019 interview, Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani undermined Trump's claim when he \"claimed Wednesday night that he 'never said there was no collusion' between President Trump's campaign and Russia leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\nGiuliani: [complained about] 'false reporting' on the Russia investigation.Cuomo: 'Mr. Mayor, false reporting is saying that nobody in the campaign had any contacts with Russia. False reporting is saying that there has been no suggestion of any kind of collusion between the campaign and any Russians.'Giuliani: 'You just misstated my position. I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign.'Cuomo: 'Yes, you have.'\n\nAfter his comments, Giuliani made statements that NPR described as an \"apparent reversal\" from his TV interview: He said \"'there was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form' and that he had 'no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign'.\"\n\nThe investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal \"conspiracy\".",

I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign.'Cuomo: 'Yes, you have.'\n\nAfter his comments, Giuliani made statements that NPR described as an \"apparent reversal\" from his TV interview: He said \"'there was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form' and that he had 'no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign'.\"\n\nThe investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal \"conspiracy\".... #### Hurricane Dorian\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian approached the Atlantic coast in August 2019, Trump presented himself as closely monitoring the situation, tweeting extensively as *The New York Times* reported he was \"assuming the role of meteorologist in chief\". On September 1, Trump tweeted that Alabama, among other states, \"will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\". By that time, no forecaster was predicting Dorian would impact Alabama and the eight National Hurricane Center forecast updates over the preceding 24 hours showed Dorian steering well away from Alabama and moving up the coast. The Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) contradicted Trump 20 minutes later, tweeting that Alabama \"will NOT see any impacts from Dorian.\" After ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl reported the correction, Trump tweeted it was \"Such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl\".\n\nOn September 4, in the Oval Office, Trump displayed a modified version of an August 29 diagram by the National Hurricane Center of the projected track of Dorian. The modification was done with a black marker and extended the cone of uncertainty of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama. Modifying government weather forecasts is illegal in the U.S. Trump was known to use a Sharpie to write on documents, as well as speech notes and on the campaign trail. A White House official told *The Washington Post* Trump had altered the diagram with a Sharpie marker. Trump said he did not know how the map came to be modified and defended his claims, saying he had \"a better map\" with models that \"in all cases [showed] Alabama was hit\". Later on September 4, Trump tweeted a map by the South Florida Water Management District dated August 28 showing numerous projected paths of Dorian; Trump falsely asserted \"almost all models\" showed Dorian approaching Alabama. A note on the map stated it was \"superseded\" by National Hurricane Center publications and that it was to be discarded if there were any discrepancies.... On September 5, after Fox News correspondent John Roberts reported about the story, Trump summoned him to the Oval Office. Roberts later characterized Trump as \"just looking for acknowledgment that he was not wrong for saying that at some point, Alabama was at risk—even if the situation had changed by the time he issued the tweet\". Trump's Homeland Security Advisor Peter Brown issued a statement asserting Trump had been provided a graphic on September 1 showing tropical storm force winds touching the southeastern corner of Alabama; a White House source told CNN that Trump had personally instructed Brown to issue the statement.\n\nOn September 6, at Trump's direction, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to order acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs to fix the contradiction by Birmingham NWS, and Ross threatened to fire top NOAA officials if he did not. NOAA then tweeted a statement by an unnamed spokesman disavowing the Birmingham NWS tweet, asserting \"the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\" adding that the Birmingham tweet \"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time\". The president of the NWS Employees Organization responded, \"the hard-working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight\". Former senior NOAA executives were sharply critical. That evening, Trump tweeted a video of a CNN hurricane forecast from the Wednesday before his Sunday tweet in which the forecaster mentioned Alabama could be affected by Dorian—with the video altered to show \"Alabama\" being repeated several times; the video ended with a CNN logo careening off a road and bursting into flames. Trump continued to insist he was correct through September 7, asserting \"The Fake News Media was fixated\" and tweeting forecast maps from at least two days before his original Sunday tweet, as the media dubbed the episode \"Sharpiegate\". Commentators expressed bafflement that Trump chose to insist he was correct about what might otherwise have passed as a minor gaffe.\n\nOn September 9, NWS director Louis Uccellini said the Birmingham NWS had not tweeted in response to Trump's tweet, but in response to phone calls and social media contacts they had received in response to Trump's tweet. \"Only later, when the retweets and politically based comments started coming to their office, did they learn the sources of this information,\" he said.",

Misinformation can cause widespread societal harm. For example, we have seen how \nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories resulted in resistance to government-recommended safety protocols \n[6,7]\nsuch as mask-wearing and vaccination . In this handbook, we will focus on debunking climate change \nmisinformation through psychological inoculation, so named for its parallels to the process of \nbiological inoculation. Psychological inoculation is a process of exposing people to examples of \nmisinformation techniques, including refutations of the misinformation, so that they build “cognitive \nantibodies,” enabling them to spot and resist misinformation in the future. Psychological inoculation \n[14]\nhas proven effective across a number of topics, including climate change .\nHuman-induced climate change is causing changes to our weather, our ecosystems, our infrastructure, \nand our health, most of which are having adverse consequences.

Climate Myth Debunking for \nBroadcast Meteorologists\n05\nBreaking the Climate Silence\nResearch has shown that many people choose not to talk about climate change—and other issues\n—because they fear judgment or pushback from others. This comes from a phenomenon known as \npluralistic ignorance—the tendency for people to misperceive others' opinions, thinking that they are in a \nminority when in reality, most others hold the same opinions\n[8]. This has been a barrier in the past that \nprevented broadcast meteorologists from discussing climate change on air. However, a majority (62%) \nof broadcast meteorologists who share climate-change-related information with their audiences \nreceive mostly positive responses from their audience\n[21].\nWhile the fear of being disliked or losing respect of the audience after discussing climate change is \ncertainly understandable, broadcast meteorologists can rest assured that 70% of Americans believe \nclimate change is happening, and will appreciate hearing about climate change from broadcasters\n[8, 21, 10, 11].\nHow to Structure a Debunking\nAn effective debunking should aim to incorporate the following elements, following the Fact-Myth-\nFallacy-Fact structure\n[13]:\n\nClimate Myth Debunking for \nBroadcast Meteorologists\n06\nClimate change is \ncaused by the sun\n“\n“\nFact-Myth-Fallacy-Fact Example...

It was correct at the time of writing. Our latest fact checks about Covid-19 and the pandemic can be found here.*\n\nA video on Instagram that has been viewed more than 20,000 times claims that a second wave of Covid-19 has been planned, and Covid-19 vaccines are going to be fatal.\n\nBoth claims are false.\n\nConspiracy theories about the planning of Covid-19 have been shared widely on social media before. These include claims that Full Fact has already debunked, including that Event 201 (a pandemic response planning exercise) was a “rehearsal” for the coronavirus pandemic, that the virus was man-made and that Bill Gates owns the vaccine for or patent of Covid-19.\n\nThere is no evidence that the creation or spread of Covid-19 has at any point been orchestrated by political, commercial or other organisations/institutions.... In any case, a “second-wave” of Covid-19 cases has already happened (at least in the UK) and political leaders have begun warning of a third wave rise in cases.\n\nWe have also repeatedly debunked claims that Covid-19 vaccines are deadly. Analysis by the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) did not suggest that fatalities of early recipients were caused by the vaccine. It also found the none of the serious adverse reactions reported appear to have been caused by the vaccine.\n\nMore recent data on the Yellow Card scheme (the UK system for collecting and monitoring information on safety concerns such as suspected side effects or adverse incidents involving medicines and medical devices) shows that despite many millions of vaccine doses administered no new safety concerns have been reported. The MHRA also notes that of the “medical conditions reported in temporal association with vaccination, the available evidence does not currently suggest that the vaccine caused the event.”\n\n**Update 16 August 2021**\n\nA line was added at the beginning of this article to reflect new information about vaccine safety, which appeared after it was published.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

              "snippet": "Abraham Lincoln did not have social media in his time. If he did, I honestly believe he might have reconsidered his final observation that \"you cannot fool all the people all the time.\" There have been a few stories in recent years that have made their way through cyberspace that have been pretty much off the wall … so much so, you would think that very few, if any, people would be fooled.\n\nBut in reality, a surprisingly large number of people took them at face value, believing they were true.\n\nThe most famous, of course, is the annual \"Mars Hoax,\" which rears its ugly head every August. Ever since a historically close approach of the Red Planet to Earth occurred in August 2003, a spurious Internet story has circulated every year since, which implies that on a specific night in late August, Mars will loom in the sky as the same size as the full moon. Totally untrue, of course, yet every year there are countless people who actually believe it will happen.\n\nThen earlier this year, a widely shared story on the Web claimed that Jan. 4 was \"Zero Gravity Day,\" a date when people on Earth would supposedly be able to experienceweightlessness if they jumped into the air at a specific moment that day. One has to wonder just how many people worldwide actually tried to float on that day.... And now, are you ready for this? Sunday (Nov. 15), the Earth supposedly will be plunged into darkness for 15 days, all thanks to a \"rare phenomenon\" caused by the movement of Venus and Jupiter. [10 Alien Encounter Claims Debunked]\n\nOf course, like the Mars story and Zero Gravity Day, this supposed worldwide blackout is false. And yet, the Internet is crackling with all sorts of reports on what to expect.\n\n**A fake news space meme**\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\nA fake news site — \"Newswatch 33\" — is apparently the reference source for this bogus report. The Earth, the report says, will go dark Nov. 15, just before 3 a.m. (no clue if this is Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific Standard or any other time). Then, after 15 days, the eerie darkness will finally lift on Nov. 30, at 4:45 p.m.\n\nPresident Barack Obama purportedly has been briefed about the upcoming phenomenon in a 1,000-page memorandum from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.\n\nThe reason given for the blackout? The recent close conjunction of Venus and Jupiterin the predawn morning sky of Oct. 26. Venus, always the brightest planet, came so close to Jupiter as seen from here on Earth that its dazzling light heated the Jovian atmosphere.... Of course, the two planets were actually separated in space by 535 million miles (860 million kilometers); the fake news story somehow manages to overlook that important point. [See photos of Venus and Jupiter in the Night Sky]\n\nJupiter's reaction to Venus' \"close approach\" was to supposedly release a huge amount of hydrogen into its atmosphere, which in turn was apparently ejected into space and Sunday will induce a massive explosion on the sun.\n\nWait … it gets better.\n\nThe story continues to claim that the sun will then react to the outburst by attempting to cool itself down and in the process,\n\n*will then turn blue* as a result.\n\nAnd that's when everything on this planet of ours is supposed to go dark.\n\nThe apocryphal details go on to claim that Bolden doesn't think the Earth will experience any major issues during the blackout: \"This event will be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter,\" Bolden supposedly says. \"The only other effect it will have is everyone will get to have a true Black Friday after Thanksgiving.\"\n\nThere's even a hashtag — #NovemberBlackOut — where people can tweet what they are going to do during the days of darkness.\n\n**A cosmic case of nonsense**\n\nAll of this is complete and utter nonsense, of course! The sun will continue shining through Thanksgiving, just as it does every year.... Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" hoax was has been circulated a few times before, most recently this past June.\n\nSnopes, the website that reports on the validity of rumors and urban legends, has also posted its own take on this fallacy: http://www.snopes.com/15-days-darkness-november/\n\nBottom line: Planet Earth will not go dark on Sunday … or at any time in the near (or distant) future. Any email or social media claims to the contrary are completely bogus.\n\nDon’t keep your family and friends \"in the dark\" (pun firmly intended) and spread the word.\n\n*Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York's Hayden Planetarium.

However, our research reveals the claim is misleading. A reverse image search traced the visuals to Lviv, Ukraine, dating back to August 2021. The footage matches earlier reports and was even covered by the Ukrainian news outlet 24 Kanal, which published the story under the headline “Lviv Covered by Unique Thundercloud: Amazing Video”. Thus, the viral claim linking the phenomenon to a recent event in India is false.\n\n### Claim:\n\nA viral video circulating on social media claims to show a massive cloud formation over Gurugram, Haryana, and the Delhi NCR region on 3rd September 2025. The cloud appears to be a cumulonimbus formation, which is typically associated with heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and severe weather conditions.\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nAfter conducting a reverse image search on key frames of the viral video, we found matching visuals from videos that attribute the phenomenon to Lviv, a city in Ukraine. These videos date back to August 2021, thereby debunking the claim that the footage depicts a recent weather event over Gurugram, Haryana, or the Delhi NCR region.\n\nFurther research revealed that a Ukrainian news channel named 24 Kanal, had reported on the Lviv thundercloud phenomenon in August 2021. The report was published under the headline “Lviv Covered by Unique Thundercloud: Amazing Video” ( original in Russian, translated into English).... ###\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe viral video does not depict a recent weather event in Gurugram or Delhi NCR, but rather an old incident from Lviv, Ukraine, recorded in August 2021. Verified sources, including Ukrainian media coverage, confirm this. Hence, the circulating claim is misleading and false.\n\n- Claim: Old Thundercloud Video from Lviv city in Ukraine Ukraine (2021) Falsely Linked to Delhi NCR, Gurugram and Haryana.\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading.\n\n### Executive Summary:\n\nA viral social media claim alleges that India’s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Anil Chauhan, praised Pakistan’s Army as superior during “Operation Sindoor.” Fact-checking confirms the claim is false. The original video, available on The Hindu’s official channel, shows General Chauhan inaugurating Ran-Samwad 2025 in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. At the 1:22:12 mark, the genuine segment appears, proving the viral clip was altered. Additionally, analysis using Hiya AI Audio identified voice manipulation, flagging the segment as a deepfake with an authenticity score of 1/100. The fabricated statement was: “never mess with Pakistan because their army appears to be far more superior.” Thus, the viral video is doctored and misleading.... ###\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, we located the full version of the video on the official YouTube channel of the Press Information Bureau (PIB), published on 11 May 2025. In this video, at the 59:57-minute mark, the Vice Admiral can be heard saying:\n\n“This time if Pakistan dares take any action, and Pakistan knows it, what we are going to do. That’s all.”\n\nFurther analysis was conducted using the Hive Moderation tool to examine the authenticity of the circulating clip. The results indicated that the video had been artificially generated, with clear signs of AI manipulation. This suggests that the content was not genuine but rather created with the intent to mislead viewers and spread misinformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n###\n\nThe viral video attributing remarks to Vice Admiral AN Pramod about India seeking U.S. and President Trump’s intervention against Pakistan is misleading. The extended speech, available on the Press Information Bureau’s official YouTube channel, contained no such statement. Instead of the alleged claim, the Vice Admiral concluded his comments by saying, “That’s all.” AI analysis using Hive Moderation further indicated that the viral clip had been artificially manipulated, with fabricated audio inserted to misrepresent his words. These findings confirm that the video is altered and does not reflect the Vice Admiral’s actual remarks.\n\nClaim: Fake Viral Video Claiming Vice Admiral AN Pramod saying that next time if Pakistan Attack we will complain to US and Prez Trump.\n\nClaimed On: Social Media\n\nFact Check: False and Misleading... ### Executive Summary:\n\n###\n\nA video circulating on social media falsely claims to show Indian Air Chief Marshal AP Singh admitting that India lost six jets and a Heron drone during Operation Sindoor in May 2025. It has been revealed that the footage had been digitally manipulated by inserting an AI generated voice clone of Air Chief Marshal Singh into his recent speech, which was streamed live on August 9, 2025.\n\n**Claim:**\n\nA viral video (archived video) (another link) shared by an X user stating in the caption “ Breaking: Finally Indian Airforce Chief admits India did lose 6 Jets and one Heron UAV during May 7th Air engagements.” which is actually showing the Air Chief Marshal has admitted the aforementioned loss during Operation Sindoor.\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nBy conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, we found a clip which was posted by ANI Official X handle , after watching the full clip we didn't find any mention of the aforementioned alleged claim.\n\nOn further research we found an extended version of the video in the Official YouTube Channel of ANI which was published on 9th August 2025. At the 16th Air Chief Marshal L.M. Katre Memorial Lecture in Marathahalli, Bengaluru, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh did not mention any loss of six jets or a drone in relation to the conflict with Pakistan. The discrepancies observed in the viral clip suggest that portions of the audio may have been digitally manipulated.\n\nThe audio in the viral video, particularly the segment at the 29:05 minute mark alleging the loss of six Indian jets, appeared to be manipulated and displayed noticeable inconsistencies in tone and clarity.... ### Conclusion:\n\nThe viral video claiming that Air Chief Marshal AP Singh admitted to the loss of six jets and a Heron UAV during Operation Sindoor is misleading. A reverse image search traced the footage that no such remarks were made. Further an extended version on ANI’s official YouTube channel confirmed that, during the 16th Air Chief Marshal L.M. Katre Memorial Lecture, no reference was made to the alleged losses. Additionally, the viral video’s audio, particularly around the 29:05 mark, showed signs of manipulation with noticeable inconsistencies in tone and clarity.\n\n- Claim: Viral Video Claiming IAF Chief Acknowledged Loss of Jets Found Manipulated\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n****\n\nA viral video (archive link) claims General Upendra Dwivedi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), admitted to losing six Air Force jets and 250 soldiers during clashes with Pakistan. Verification revealed the footage is from an IIT Madras speech, with no such statement made. AI detection confirmed parts of the audio were artificially generated.\n\n**** **Claim:**\n\n****... The claim in question is that General Upendra Dwivedi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), admitted to losing six Indian Air Force jets and 250 soldiers during recent clashes with Pakistan.\n\n**** **Fact Check:**\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, it was found that the original footage is from IIT Madras, where the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) was delivering a speech. The video is available on the official YouTube channel of ADGPI – Indian Army, published on 9 August 2025, with the description:\n\n*“Watch COAS address the faculty and students on ‘Operation Sindoor – A New Chapter in India’s Fight Against Terrorism,’ highlighting it as a calibrated, intelligence-led operation reflecting a doctrinal shift. On the occasion, he also focused on the major strides made in technology absorption and capability development by the Indian Army, while urging young minds to strive for excellence in their future endeavours.”*\n\nA review of the full speech revealed no reference to the destruction of six jets or the loss of 250 Army personnel. This indicates that the circulating claim is not supported by the original source and may contribute to the spread of misinformation.\n\nFurther using AI Detection tools like Hive Moderation we found that the voice is AI generated in between the lines.... **** **Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is baseless. The video is a manipulated creation that combines genuine footage of General Dwivedi’s IIT Madras address with AI-generated audio to fabricate a false narrative. No credible source corroborates the alleged military losses.\n\n- Claim: AI-Generated Audio Falsely Claims COAS Admitted to Loss of 6 Jets and 250 Soldiers\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nAs we researched a viral social media video we encountered, we did a comprehensive fact check utilizing reverse image search. The video circulated with the claim that it shows illegal Bangladeshi in Assam's Goalpara district carrying homemade spears and attacking a police and/or government official. Our findings are certain that this claim is false. This video was filmed in the Kishoreganj district, Bangladesh, on July 1, 2025, during a political argument involving two rival factions of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The footage has been intentionally misrepresented, putting the report into context regarding Assam to disseminate false information.\n\n**Claim:**\n\nThe viral video shows illegal Bangladeshi immigrants armed with spears marching in Goalpara, Assam, with the intention of attacking police or officials.... Claim: Video shows illegal migrants with spears moving in groups to assault police!\n\nClaimed On: Social Media\n\nFact Check: False and Misleading",

The digitally manipulated video is part of a Pakistani propaganda campaign, and the PIB has urged people to rely on verified sources and report suspicious content.\n\nEver since the Indian Armed Forces targeted terrorist establishments in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under Operation Sindoor to avenge the death of 26 people in the Pahalgam terrorist attack, fake posts about the Indian Army have been circulating on social media. One such post by Pakistani propaganda accounts falsely shows a digitally altered video of Western Command Chief Lt Gen Manoj Kumar Katiyar, claiming that payments were made to the Afghan Taliban to act against Pakistan. The post further alleged that the Taliban accepted the money and are now fighting for India against Pakistan.\n\n**PIB debunks fake video**\n\nThe Press Information Bureau (PIB) has firmly debunked the misinformation, stating, \"Western Command Chief Lt. Gen. Manoj Kumar Katiyar has NOT given any such statement!\" The PIB clarified that these AI-manipulated videos are part of a propaganda campaign aimed at misleading the public and creating panic. The bureau also shared a YouTube link to the genuine, unedited video for public verification, urging people to rely only on authentic sources.... **How to report fake content**\n\nThe PIB added, \"If you spot such content, please report it to us on 8799711259 and mail at factcheck@pib.gov.in. .\" Authorities have also urged public vigilance to prevent the spread of misleading information.\n\n**India-Pakistan conflict**\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces launched a massive operation against terror groups in Pakistan and PoK in retaliation to the Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 innocent people. India launched ardent and precise strikes under Operation Sindoor, destroying over nine terror camps. These locations were key command centres of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), responsible for major attacks like Pulwama (2019) and Mumbai (2008). More than 100 terrorists were killed in the attack.\n\nIn retaliation, Pakistan attempted strikes on Indian military bases over the next three days - May 8, 9, and 10. Reacting to this, India launched missile and drone attacks, targeting key military establishments of Pakistan. After four days of intense cross-border drone and missile exchanges, Pakistan reached out to India and requested for a ceasefire.\n\n**ALSO READ: Fact check: PIB debunks fake video of Trump discussing India-Pakistan conflict, shares original clip**",

Fine urban particulate levels owing to limited dispersion from light daytime winds and limited morning vertical mixing over portions of far West Texas are expected to occasionally raise PM2.5/PM10 levels to the \"Moderate\" range, however the overall daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs are forecast to net out in the \"Good\" range for the majority of the region, which includes the El Paso area.\n\nLight winds, warm temperatures, sufficient afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels could be enough for ozone to reach the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Houston, Midland-Odessa, and San Antonio areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Amarillo, Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-McAllen, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, Laredo, Lubbock, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.\n\nA large portion of the light density residual smoke attributed to the scattered prescribed burning activities across parts of the Mississippi River Valley and East Texas is forecast to begin exiting the state as a cold front moves over West Texas, the Texas Panhandle, the Permian Basin, and North Central Texas. While some of the smoke combined with slightly elevated light density urban fine particulate aerosols associated with light morning winds or slightly elevated relative humidity levels over the eastern two-thirds of Texas may raise PM2.5 levels to the \"Moderate\" range at times, the overall daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to net out in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Brownsville-McAllen and Houston areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, Laredo, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.... Light winds, warm temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels could be enough for ozone to reach the upper end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas; the middle of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin and San Antonio areas; the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Bryan-College Station, Midland-Odessa, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas; and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Laredo, and Victoria areas.\n\nDepending on the amount of prescribed burning activities across parts of the Mississippi River Valley and East Texas, light density residual smoke may begin to expand over portions of East and Southeast Texas, slightly raising fine particulate levels. Meanwhile, another cold front is forecast to move through far West Texas, the Texas Panhandle, the Permian Basin, and a portion of North Central Texas. The light density residual smoke combined with slightly elevated urban fine particulate aerosols, mainly over South Central, North Central, Northeast, and Southeast Texas, converging along and ahead of the leading edge of the cold frontal boundary, may result in slightly increased PM2.5 levels as the front approaches. The overall daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to rise to the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas and to the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-McAllen, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, and Victoria areas....

Overall, the daily PM2.5 AQI may remain in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Brownsville-McAllen and Houston areas and should net out in the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.... Slightly elevated urban fine particulate background levels over portions of far West Texas associated with light daytime winds and limited morning vertical mixing could maintain the daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs at the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area.\n\nThis forecast was last updated at 11:15 AM on Friday, October 17th, and is updated daily on normal TCEQ workdays and may also be updated on weekends or holidays when air pollution levels are high.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... The large crater J. Herschel spans 96 miles and betrays its age in two ways. First, the poor rim has been long battered down by smaller impacts and has so many dents that the low-angle sunlight easily streams into the middle. And second, what would have been a complex jumble of central peaks lies buried under the immense amount of rubble thrown out by the giant impact that carved out the Imbrium basin. It looks like someone has kicked dirt on a key lime pie.\nCloser to the pole, the 44-mile-wide Philolaus has much younger features, most notably a sharp and tall rim that casts a long, dark shadow. Return for the next night or two to see its twin central peaks. Herschel may be unrecognizable by now. (Philolaus was a 5th-century Greek who followed Pythagoras and said that Earth was moving. John Herschel charted the southern sky.)\nYou can try again on Nov. 1st, with lighting 10 hours later than pictured here.\nMeteor Watch: Perfect conditions\nThe Orionid meteor shower peaks Oct. 21, although it is active between Oct. 2 and Nov. 7. This annual event is renowned for its swift, bright meteors that radiate from the constellation Orion, near the star Betelgeuse. Under optimal conditions — clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution — viewers can expect up to 20 meteors per hour in the predawn hours when the radiant is high in the sky. The radiant rises in the east before midnight and reaches its highest point in the sky around 5:30 a.m., making the early-morning hours ideal for observation. This year the New Moon on Oct. 21 ensures dark skies, enhancing visibility. To fully appreciate the spectacle, find a dark location, lie back, and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness.... Did a nova just appear below Saturn? Peaking up to 2nd magnitude, the larger geostationary satellites reflect sunlight from their solar panels. Lower satellites move across the sky, but for these big birds, the sky moves slowly past them. The time of peak brightness shifts about four minutes earlier each night.\nCeres spends all month within a short distance of several bright stars, aiding in its identification.

              "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude.

It is defined as the closest Full Moon to autumnal (fall) equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAs well as being named after the harvest season in the northern half of the globe, the moonrise times around Full Moon at the autumnal equinox are favorable to getting in the harvest. This is because the difference in the time between moonrise from one night to the next becomes\n\n**less than the average of 50 minutes**. The result is that, for **several nights in a row, there’s extra moonlight in the evenings**. Historically, this gave farmers more time to harvest crops.\n\nThe opposite takes effect in the Southern Hemisphere around the September equinox with\n\n**more** than 50 minutes between moonrise from one day to the next around the Full Moon.... ## Two Meteor Showers in October\n\nMeteors, or shooting stars, are the bright streaks of light that occur when a meteoroid—a rock in space—hits our atmosphere and burns up. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid.\n\nOctober boasts two meteor showers: the\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaking around October 8–9, and the **Orionid meteor shower** peaking around October 20–21. The bad news is that the glare from the bright Full Moon will reduce the number of Draconids that are visible this year. The good news is that the Orionids peak close to New Moon, when the night sky is at its darkest.\n\nThe origin of the Draconids is the dust trail left by comet\n\n**21P/Giacobini-Zinner**. Meanwhile, the Orionids have a more famous parent body: **Halley’s Comet**. Have a look at our tips for watching meteor showers.\n\n## Coral Spawning Follows October Full Moon\n\nIn the days after Full Moon in October and November, corals in Australia’s\n\n**Great Barrier Reef** simultaneously release bundles of eggs and sperm into the sea. This phenomenon is called **coral spawning**.\n\nThe event only happens at night, and its timing hinges on a number of factors including Moon phase, water temperatures, salinity levels, and the length of day.\n\nIn the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the inshore reefs usually spawn in\n\n**October**; the outer reefs tend to spawn during **November** or **December**. Meanwhile at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Texas and Louisiana in the USA, coral spawning typically happens after the **August** Full Moon.... ## Mercury Makes a Bright Appearance\n\nMercury shines bright on October 29 as it reaches its\n\n**greatest elongation east**. In general, the days on either side of greatest elongations are the best time to catch the innermost planet in our solar system.\n\nBecause Mercury is small and lies close to the Sun, it can be a challenge to observe. But at greatest elongation east, there is a chance to see it with the naked eye soon after sunset.\n\nAnd the elusive Mercury tends to favor one or other of the hemispheres—this time stargazers in the\n\n**Southern Hemisphere** get the best view.\n\nThere will be a close approach of Mercury and Mars on\n\n**October 20**, seen here from Sydney, Australia, as the two planets set.\n\nAnd on\n\n**October 23**, the Waxing Crescent Moon will join Mercury and Mars—as seen here in Sydney at around 20:15 (8:15 pm) local time.\n\n**But beware:** Do not try to observe objects close to the Sun while any part of the Sun is above the horizon. Never point binoculars or a telescope in the direction of the Sun—it **can cause permanent eye damage**.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Which planets are in the night sky tonight?\n\nOur Interactive Night Sky Map gives the rise and set times for the planets in your town or city.... ## How many planets are there?\n\nAccording to the latest definition, there are 8 planets in our solar system.\n\n## How long does it take to get to Venus?\n\nA typical journey time is around four or five months.",

A Supermoon takes over, the Draconid meteor shower peeks through, and the Orionid meteors sparkle across the night sky.\nThe evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because - it's a supermoon!\nThis evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why?\nSupermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with \"perigee,\" which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month.\nSo this is an exceptionally close full moon! Which explains its spectacular appearance.\nAnd what timing - while the supermoon appears on October 6th, just a couple of days before on October 4th is \"International Observe the Moon Night\"!... It's an annual, worldwide event when Moon enthusiasts come together to enjoy our natural satellite.You can attend or host a moon-viewing party, or simply observe the Moon from wherever you are.\nSo look up, and celebrate the moon along with people all around the world!\nThe supermoon will light up the sky on October 6th, but if you luck into some dark sky between October 6th and 10th, you might witness the first of two October meteor showers - the Draconids!\nThe Draconid meteor shower comes from debris trailing the comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner burning up in Earth's atmosphere\nThese meteors originate from nearby the head of the constellation Draco the dragon in the northern sky and the shower can produce up to 10 meteors per hour!\nThe Draconids peak around October 8th, but if you don't see any, you can always blame the bright supermoon and wait a few weeks until the next meteor shower - the Orionids!\nThe Orionid meteor shower, peaking October 21, is set to put on a spectacular show, shooting about 20 meteors per hour across the night sky.\nThis meteor shower happens when Earth travels through the debris trailing behind Halley's Comet and it burns up in our atmosphere.... The full duration of the meteor shower stretches from September 26 to November 22, but your best bet to see meteors is on October 21 before midnight until around 2 am.\nThis is because, not only is this night the shower's peak, it is also the October new moon, meaning the moon will be between the Earth and the Sun, making it dark and invisible to us.\nWith a moonless sky, you're much more likely to catch a fireball careening through the night.\nSo find a dark location after the sun has set, look to the southeast sky (if you're in the northern hemisphere) and the northeast (if you're in the southern hemisphere) and enjoy!\nOrionid meteors appear to come from the direction of the Orion constellation but you might catch them all across the sky.\nHere are the phases of the Moon for October.\nYou can stay up to date on all of NASA's missions exploring the solar system and beyond at science.nasa.gov.",

              "snippet": "## Meteor Showers in Early and Late October\n\n### The Draconids – Dragon Meteors Under a Bright Moon\n\nThe\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaks around October 8, 2025, but this year the “Dragon” will have its fire stolen by moonlight. The Draconids are a minor shower (often only ~10 meteors per hour under dark skies [1]), and unfortunately a **full Moon on October 6–7** will flood the night sky with light during the peak [2]. The bright moonlight will wash out all but the brightest Draconid meteors, making them hard to spot. Best chance to catch a few “shooting stars” from Draco’s radiant (near the Dragon’s head in the northern sky) is *as soon as darkness falls* on October 8, before the Moon rises too high [3]. This unusual timing – evening instead of predawn – is because Draconid meteors fly in the early night hours (the shower’s radiant is highest in the sky at nightfall) [4].\n\nWhy bother with a faint shower? The Draconids are infamous for occasional\n\n**outbursts**. In rare years, if Earth passes through a dense clump of debris from the shower’s parent comet (21P/Giacobini-Zinner), the Draconids have surprised observers with hundreds or even thousands of meteors per hour (notably in 1933 and 1946) [5] [6]. Most years are quiet, but the comet did reach perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in March 2025, raising the *possibility* of enhanced activity [7] [8]. “Watch out if the Dragon awakes!” writes one skywatching columnist – that slim chance of a meteor storm keeps many enthusiasts outdoors **even in moonlight** during this shower [9]. While a storm is not expected, keep an eye on the northern sky on October 8–9 just in case. (The Draconids favor observers in the **Northern Hemisphere**; those far south won’t see much, as Draco sits low or below the horizon.)... ### The Orionids – Halley’s Comet’s Encore\n\nLater in the month comes the\n\n**Orionid meteor shower**, peaking on the night of October 21–22, 2025. The Orionids are debris from the famous **Halley’s Comet** and are known for fast, fine meteors. In a typical year, the Orionid shower produces about **20 meteors per hour at peak under clear dark skies** [10]. Some years have surged higher (50–70 per hour in exceptional displays), but recently Orionids have been modest, around 20–30 per hour [11]. Fortunately, conditions in 2025 will be *nearly ideal*: the peak falls under a **new Moon**, so **no moonlight will interfere** [12]. In fact, the Moon will be only ~2% illuminated and rises near dawn, essentially leaving the late-night sky perfectly dark [13] [14] for meteor spotting.\n\nThe best time to watch is\n\n**after midnight until pre-dawn** on Oct. 21/22, once the constellation Orion (the shower’s radiant near Orion’s Club) climbs high. Orionids are swift – striking Earth almost head-on at 66 km/s – which often yields long, quick streaks [15]. They can appear anywhere in the sky, so find a dark location, lie back, and scan around Orion and the neighboring constellations. This shower is visible from both the **Northern and Southern Hemispheres**, as Orion straddles the celestial equator [16] [17]. NASA notes that the Orionids’ parent, Halley’s Comet, also causes the Eta Aquariids in May – making Halley “a two-for-one deal” for meteor fans each year [18]. With no Moon to spoil the show in 2025, **experts predict excellent viewing conditions**, so this could be one of the top meteor showers of the year [19].... ## Planetary Highlights and Conjunctions\n\nOctober 2025 offers plenty of planet spotting opportunities. Two bright planets,... **at peak brilliance**in these weeks – astronomers rate it around magnitude –4.5, the brightest it gets all year [48] [49]. **Tip:**after observing Venus and the Moon, scan higher up for fainter **Mars**(see below) and toward the west for Jupiter setting at dawn. **Mercury and Mars at Dusk:**Fleet-footed **Mercury**makes a challenging appearance in late October. On **October 29**, Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation, 23° away from the Sun in the evening sky [50]. This is actually Mercury’s *last*evening apparition of 2025, but it’s not particularly favorable for those in the Northern Hemisphere. Even at maximum separation, Mercury will be low in the bright twilight (it sets shortly after the Sun). Still, around the final week of October, persistent observers might catch Mercury as a faint “star” very low on the **west-southwest horizon**about 30–45 minutes after sunset [51]. Binoculars will help you spot it in the glow. (Observers in the Southern Hemisphere get a slightly better viewing angle, so Mercury will be a bit higher for them.) Intriguingly, **Mars**is also lurking in the same area of sky. Mars, now on the far side of the Sun and very faint, has been sinking into the sunset glare each evening. Around **October 19–23**, Mercury and Mars actually pass each other in what would be a *conjunction*– but this happens so deep in twilight that it’s a tough observation. Mercury is emerging upward from solar conjunction while Mars is vanishing downward into it, so they are both extremely low after sunset [52]. High Point Scientific notes this pairing gives a brief opportunity to see the two planets close together as they trade places relative to the Sun [53]. If you have a **very clear view of the western horizon**on Oct. 19–20, you might attempt a sighting: about 15–20 minutes after sunset, scan for Mercury (the brighter of the two) and see if you can also glimpse dim Mars nearby. Realistically, Mars will likely be invisible without a telescope. By early November, Mars is in conjunction with the Sun and gone. So think of this as **Mercury’s farewell to Mars**in the twilight – a symbolic handoff from one planet to the other.... ## Comets and Cosmic Visitors\n\nComet enthusiasts have much to be excited about in late 2025. October brings the potential for... *(Comet source refs: StarWalk/Starry Night guides [88] [89] [90]; NASA Science [91] [92]; Chron/EarthSky for context [93].)*... ## Auroras on the Rise – Eyes North (or South)!\n\nHigh-latitude skywatchers should stay alert this October for\n\n**aurora borealis** (Northern Lights) or aurora australis (Southern Lights). Solar activity is near its 11-year peak in 2025 – in fact, the Sun’s **solar maximum** is predicted for around July 2025 [94]. That means the Sun is freckled with sunspots and prone to eruptions like flares and coronal mass ejections, which send charged particles hurtling toward Earth. When those particles strike our atmosphere, they trigger the glowing curtains of auroras. The past year has already seen an uptick in auroral displays, and experts say 2025 will continue the trend [95] [96]. *“Aurora activity can often peak after solar maximum, meaning that the next couple of years will likely be an exciting time for aurora watchers,”* notes Dr. Renate Mauland-Hus, an astrophysicist interviewed by TimeandDate [97].\n\nOctober (along with the spring) is traditionally an excellent season for auroras because of the\n\n**equinox effect** – for reasons still being studied, geomagnetic disturbances seem to be more frequent around the equinoxes. With the **nights growing longer** in October, any geomagnetic storm has more hours of darkness to be observed. In practical terms, this means if the Sun belches out a strong Earth-directed solar flare or CME in September/October, auroras could potentially be visible farther from the poles than usual. Already in late 2024 and early 2025, auroras have been sighted at unusually low latitudes during big solar storms [98]. So if you live in **northern Europe, Canada, the northern U.S.** or similarly high latitudes (or the far southern hemisphere equivalents), keep an eye on space weather alerts. A good resource is NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center aurora forecasts or local observatory announcements.... With a little planning, October 2025 could be an unforgettable month of skywatching. From the eerie\n\n**Draconid meteors**under an autumn sky, to the crisp mornings with **Venus and the crescent Moon**, to the spectacle of a **Harvest supermoon**, there’s a bounty of cosmic wonders to enjoy. So bundle up, find a dark sky if you can, and **enjoy the show** – the universe is putting on one nightly above us.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... Pacific Coast observers will see the pair of shadows at the onset of morning twilight Oct. 25, the last in this series for the month.\nVenus rises at 5 a.m. local daylight time on Oct. 1, shining at magnitude –3.9 among the stars of Leo. It crosses into Virgo by the 9th and its elongation from the Sun is declining, so it rises later each morning. It's joined by the waning crescent Moon on the 19th; the pair rises around 5:30 a.m. across North America. They stand less than 4° apart, with the Moon just two days from New. Through a telescope, Venus displays a 94-percent-lit disk spanning 11″.\nBy the end of October, the phase expands to 96 percent and the disk shrinks to 10″. On the 31st Venus stands 4° north of Spica, although the magnitude 1.0 star is difficult to see in the brightening sky.\nNote: Moon phases in the calendar vary in size due to the distance from Earth and are shown at 0h Universal Time.

In the south lie the elongated Schiller and the detail-packed Gassendi; the equator sports the small and sharp Kepler, leading north to the outstanding half-ring of the Jura Mountains. Keep going north for some lunar history.... Did a nova just appear below Saturn? Peaking up to 2nd magnitude, the larger geostationary satellites reflect sunlight from their solar panels. Lower satellites move across the sky, but for these big birds, the sky moves slowly past them.

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:323} an incredible 29 years to race around that track as if it was a horse track in a racetrack. We go around naturally, you\n{ts:330} know, in one year. So looking at Saturn, you may get to see with a do, you know, decent sized telescope a ring system\n{ts:337} that's maybe deployed five or six degrees. We're beginning to see the southern section of the ring as years go\n{ts:343} on. So, don't miss Saturn, a beautiful site deep in the constellation of Aquarius, the water bearer. But for\n{ts:351} other objects, you probably want to look into the eastern part of the sky right after midnight because Jupiter rises,\n{ts:359} the god of gods and the most magnificent planet. And in the early morning sky, Venus is still there. As we look into\n{ts:366} our skies, we see it into the northnortheast before sunrise. The blazing object. Venus is an incredible\n{ts:373} object. Did you know, and I've often mentioned this on the Dr. Sky Experience, that under certain\n{ts:378} conditions, if let's say you live in an area where snow is pretty much uh, you know, prominent, you can actually see... {ts:385} your shadow by the brilliance of Venus. Now, you may wonder, how could that be? Well, if you're in a snowy field because\n{ts:390} of the whiteness of snow and Venus was, of course, you're staring at it and you turned around under super dark\n{ts:397} conditions, you might get to see your shadow, not just like the moon would cast your shadow or the sun in the\n{ts:403} daytime, but the planet Venus itself, which is quite interesting. So, ladies and gentlemen, a good opportunity now to\n{ts:410} talk about a pair of binoculars. Now, I get this question on the Dr. I experience all the time. And you can\n{ts:415} email me with your questions at just drsky at wabcradio.com.\n{ts:421} I'm there for you to answer questions and no question is foolish. I mean, we get questions and help people out.\n{ts:426} That's what we do to explore the mysteries of the universe. So, a pair of binoculars, let's talk about it for a\n{ts:433} moment. You use both eyes. Hopefully, your eyes are in good health. And even if they... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

              "snippet": "{ts:4} [Music] Hello. It's October. Only three more\n{ts:11} months to the end of 20125 and I am just gobsmacked. It's going by so fast. So, let's dive into what you can expect for\n{ts:19} October. Now, I don't know about you, but I feel like September was kind of a doozy. So, let's see what is in store\n{ts:27} for us. And I'm going to again say thank you to the ladies at the wholeness network for having me do their monthly\n{ts:36} um astrological uh series here. And I can't find my advance here. Here we go. Okay. So I love the great blue\n{ts:50} heron. I was uh texting with a friend about the great blue heron and I went on a 12mi run in a Kyhoga Valley National\n{ts:58} Park and I saw this blue heron on a tree stump sticking out of the marsh with his wings like this and and I took several\n{ts:67} pictures of him. He was sleeping and I hadn't put my phone on mute so he kind of like woke up and stuck his little... {ts:74} face out. He's like it was really interesting. So, the great blue heron is amazing and beautiful and things in\n{ts:81} nature can just bring us joy all the time because the natural world is indeed special and magical. So, we didn't\n{ts:88} really cover Libra season uh when I did the September preview because there's so much going on in September. So, we're\n{ts:97} going to talk about that now. So, Libra season is basically from September 22nd, uh, when the sun moves\n{ts:107} into the sign of Libra, we start fall. It's when the autumn equinox happens. Equal light, equal day. And we know what\n{ts:114} that means. The winter solstice is next. And that means the sun has its shortest days. It's kind of that time where we go\n{ts:122} inside and bed things down. So, right now, we're harvesting. We're getting all our stuff\n{ts:128} in. we're kind of preparing for the long dark days and Libra season as we know is symbolized by the scale. Um and it's\n{ts:136} kind of like if you think of the horizon, the sun dipping down, it... 's managing our needs and\n{ts:278} managing the needs of other people with grace. So there's this cooperation in leadership. there's this um taking in\n{ts:286} all the different aspects so that the highest good can be undertaken. Full moons typically are something\n{ts:293} that's revealing. It's it's a celebration. So see if there's some areas of your life um that are kind of\n{ts:300} you know with your relationships or how you assert yourself in the world that might be coming highlighted for you\n{ts:305} during this time. and everybody's chart's personal. But one thing I thought was kind of interesting uh is\n{ts:311} that Mercury is at 0 degrees Scorpio and it's in a quinc con with Neptune. And Mercury and Neptune is an interesting\n{ts:321} combination where uh it can affect how we perceive the world. Um sometimes Neptune can be incredibly spiritual and\n{ts:328} creative. Uh other times it can be confusing or disillusionment. And so it's Mercury is our mind and how we\n{ts:336} perceive things. So if you are someone who is working on um meditation, channeling, uh mediumship, stuff like\n{ts:344} that, psychism, like this could be a really interesting time for you to set that as an intention to really expand... {ts:349} that in your life. Also, if you're like a fantasy writer, mystery writer, um create creative writing in general, or\n{ts:358} even if you're someone who is a poet, uh does automatic writing, this could be really interesting for you as well. So,\n{ts:364} see how those things uh kind of work for you. And then there's also this um Quinn Kunk to Uranus. And Uranus is a god of\n{ts:372} lightning, sudden understanding. Uh it's kind of like a higher octave of Mercury some\n{ts:379} people say. So you could have like really great flashes of insight. Uh so kind of opening up the space for you to\n{ts:386} either be transfused with something amazing like with Neptune being a sort of tuning fork to your head or amazing\n{ts:394} lightning striking with fabulous ideas that you never would have thought of because it's so out of the box. So\n{ts:400} opening up the space for that to see what might happen for you could be fun. And going on to the next thing is we\n{ts:408} have Pluto. Uh it went retrograde May 4th of 2005 and it... 's been 162 days Pluto's been\n{ts:417} retrograde to us our viewpoint and it's now going direct and that's at one degree Aquarius. So when Pluto goes\n{ts:426} backwards it's time for us to kind of take the lessons that we've learned. See how uh I I put these up as a a nice\n{ts:435} visual because I'm I'm starting to think of Pluto as like this forge. It's we don't want to be melted typically, but\n{ts:444} it's like once we're melted, we're pliable. We're in this state of becoming something different. And when\n{ts:452} they used to make swords and whatnot, they would they would put this metal into a forge and\n{ts:458} heat it up and then make these swords and then beat them. And so Pluto transits can sometimes feel like that\n{ts:465} for us where it's like I wouldn't have chosen this for myself, but once the process is done, we're like super\n{ts:472} strong. And I also um put up a pressure cooker because it's I just saw a thing recently where\n{ts:480} someone said the Pluto glyph it's a circle and there's this half crescent and then the cross of matter and it... 's\n{ts:487} almost like someone's like surrendering. They're putting their hands up like this. And so there's an element of\n{ts:493} surrender when Pluto is talking to us or is involved in our chart somehow. And it's it's like our it's not always a\n{ts:502} comfortable feeling to be in a catalyst or a crucible, which is kind of what I feel like with a pressure cooker is, but\n{ts:509} it's it changes us and then we move forward with a totally different perspective on things. So, as Pluto\n{ts:515} starts to go direct now, um the themes of Pluto being in Aquarius will kind of move forward with such things. So, I... {ts:523} know AI has just been huge. It's interesting because uh my uncle worked with IBM for years and he said really AI\n{ts:530} is a program written by a human essentially as the way it is right now the large language model and things like\n{ts:537} that. So, it's may we write programs that are full of love and higher higher um uh purposes\n{ts:548} and for the higher good of everything and kind of avoid anything that might be negative with with those things. So I\n{ts:555} think I just want to say that for for that because Pluto and Aquarius um sometimes it can be like dystopian or we\n{ts:562} always know it's going to be uh but it feels like information and things like that is one of the things that Pluto\n{ts:568} could be talking with with us with it going into Aquarius and power to the people definitely power with people and\n{ts:574} masses of people and grassroots and all that kind of stuff. Oh, I didn't get rid of my drawing. Sorry. Then we have the\n{ts:583} um new moon in Libra and this is happening at 28° Libra. So if you have late degree... {ts:662} Mars loves Scorpio. It it's the rulership is a doicile of Mars um in the nighttime and it's really a powerful\n{ts:671} sign for Mars to be in. So it's easier for Mars to express itself and Mars is our desire, our aggression, how we go\n{ts:677} after what we want, energy, drive, ambition with it right next to Mercury. uh in the previous um full moon we saw\n{ts:686} that Mercury is being aspected by Mercury is aspecting Uranus and Neptune and now we have Mars there. So Mars kind\n{ts:694} of gives this ability to be witty and sharp, incisive uh if you are talking with somebody, watching the potential\n{ts:706} inflammatory aspect like argument potential, but it's also um like like having like something important to say\n{ts:714} and saying it. And I think with the the Libra can kind of bring in that niceness where we can temper it a smidge. Uh but\n{ts:721} seeing how you uh can be clear-cut in your thinking, clearcut in how you're speaking with people and\n{ts:730} could potentially be a little argumentative here and there because Mars can be spicy. I mean definitely",

              "url": "http://www.theskyscrapers.org/october-2025-sky-events",
              "snippet": "October brings some of the most pronounced seasonal changes to our nighttime skygazing. The sounds and smells of summer have passed on, But, with the distinct scent of autumn leaves and the absence of the frogs, katydids, and all but perhaps few enough crickets to count, the still nights of autumn are getting longer, cooler, and quieter.\n\nIn the west, we see Arcturus, the brilliant star that foretells the coming of spring, and has been a presence in our evening sky since, is now low in the sky, soon to trade places to the morning sky.\n\nAs we continue to anticipate the once-in-80-year outburst of the Blaze Star, T Coronae Borealis, we have less time to observe the star during October, as it is getting lower in the northwest after sunset, sets during the mid-to-late evening, and doesn’t rise before the onset of morning twilight until about a week into November.\n\nLooking towards the south, we find our gaze turning away from the glow of the Milky Way, and towards the dimmer constellations of autumn. While Capricornus, Aquarius, Cetus, and Pisces are relatively devoid of bright stars, one notable exception is Pisces Austrinus, which gives us the lone first magnitude star, Fomalhaut, a class A3 main sequence star that lies just 25 light years away. Lying 59° east-southeast from the next-nearest first magnitude star, Altair, Fomalhaut is the most isolated of the first magnitude stars in our sky from our latitude of about 42° north.... ## Moon\n\nTo start the month of October, the 69.9% waxing gibbous Moon is just 0.8° east-southeast of Pluto on the 1st. This pairing would be quite an observing challenge, as the Moon is about 16 billion times brighter than Pluto. Capturing it photographically with a sensitive imaging device is a bit more feasible. If you can observe the two objects simultaneously, consider that Pluto’s light took four hours 51 minutes to reach us, and that the distant dwarf planet is 13,329 times the distance from Earth as the Moon.\n\nOctober 4th is International Observe the Moon Night, but this year we’ll be celebrating on Sunday the 5th. Watch the 98% waxing gibbous Moon rise at 5:34pm over the Seekonk River with Skyscrapers members and friends from Blackstone Field on the East Side of Providence, adjacent to the Narragansett Boat Club on River Drive. Bring a telescope, binoculars, or a camera, and enjoy the moonrise with us. The Moon will be just 2.2° north-northwest of Saturn on this evening. A few hours later, early on the morning of the 6th, the Moon is 1.8° north-northwest of Neptune. Throughout the evening, you should be able to observe all three objects simultaneously in a small telescope with a wide field of view.... The Moon is full at 11:48pm on the 6th, marking 2025’s Harvest Moon, as October’s full Moon is 14.5 hours closer to the equinox than September’s full Moon. The Harvest Moon is in Pisces, and rises at 5:57pm, when the Sun is still above the horizon, making this full Moon rise a very favorable one to photograph.\n\nWe have missed the last several occurrences of it, either because it happens during daylight for us, or the Moon is below the horizon, but October gives us our first nighttime view of the Moon occulting the Pleiades.\n\nThe first of the brighter members, Celaeno (16 Tauri), is occulted beginning at 11:36pm on the 9th. Electra (17 Tauri) is occulted about three minutes later. At 11:54pm, Taygeta (19 Tauri) dips behind the bright limb of the Moon, followed by Maia (20 Tauri) at 12:04am on the 10th.\n\nElectra emerges at 12:19am, followed by Celaeno at 12:39am, Taygeta at 12:58am, and Maia at 1:08am.\n\nThe Moon reaches its most northerly declination during lunation 1271 on the 12th, at +28.27° in the non-zodiacal constellation Auriga.... ## Mercury\n\nMercury spends October in its least favorable evening apparition of the year for northern hemisphere observers. While it reaches its maximum elongation of 23.9° east of the Sun on the 29th, it never spends more than an hour above the horizon following sunset, during which time it remains low over the southwestern horizon.\n\nDue to Mercury’s inclination angle keeping it south of the ecliptic, which is already at a low angle of incidence during October evenings, the planet doesn’t gain considerable elevation over the horizon, but continues to appear further towards the south each evening.\n\nIf you’re searching for Mercury on the 2nd, you may notice magnitude 1.0 Spica, which lies 1.7° to the south-southwest of the magnitude -0.5 planet.\n\nThe innermost planet joins the Moon and Mars, with the three appearing in a line on the 23rd. You’ll be able to locate the 5.3% crescent moon first, then, with binoculars, go 3.9° to the north-northeast, or right and slightly above, to find Mercury. Then, continue along this direction another 3.0° to locate Mars.\n\n## Venus\n\nVenus is now over 1.5 au from Earth, moving along the far side of its orbit towards superior conjunction in early January. It is visible low in the eastern sky before sunrise, rising about 2½ minutes later each morning. Its gibbous disk has shrunk to just about 11 arcseconds, but the planet still retains its brilliance at magnitude -3.9.\n\nVenus crosses into Virgo on the 9th.\n\nOn the 19th, the super slim crescent Moon is just 4.1° southwest of Venus.... ## Saturn\n\nOctober’s evening skies offer Saturn as the only bright planet in an optimal position for viewing. Moving retrograde through Aquarius, the ringed planet can be found in the southeastern sky after twilight fades.\n\nOn the 5th, the nearly full Moon is just 2.2° to the north-northwest of Saturn, and with a wide field telescope, you’ll be able to see not just the Moon and Saturn, but also Neptune, which is 2.0° to the east of the Moon.\n\n**Moons of Saturn**\n\nThe last of Titan’s shadow transits visible to us begins at 12:26am on the 6th, when the shadow of Saturn’s giant moon grazes the northern limb of the planet, departing after 1:42am. As this is still relatively close to Saturn’s opposition, there is also a coinciding transit of the moon itself, beginning at 9:25pm on the 5th, ending at 1:44am on the 6th.\n\nWhile the next shadow transit of Titan will not occur until 2038, the moon itself continues to transit the planet's disk a few more times, and keen observers with larger instruments, exceptionally good observing conditions, and sensitive image equipment may be able to track Saturn’s smaller, inner moons as they continue to cast shadows across the planet’s cloudtops throughout the next several months.\n\nTitan enters occultation at 6:57pm on the 13th, during nautical twilight. It remains behind Saturn and in eclipse until 12:50am.\n\nAnother transit of Titan, without its shadow, takes place on the 21st, beginning at 6:45pm. The moon takes nearly six hours to cross Saturn’s northern equatorial belt.\n\nOn the 29th, Titan emerges from occultation at 10:22pm while partially eclipsed. It comes out of eclipse a few minutes past midnight on the 30th.\n\nTitan comes out of eclipse at 00:00pm on the 29th.... ## Comets\n\n**C/2025 R2 (SWAN)**\n\nDiscovered on September 11, 2025 in images captured with the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument onboard NASA’s Solar and Heliophysics Observatory (SOHO), Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN is in our evening sky throughout October, hovering around 9th magnitude before fading rapidly as it moves out of the inner solar system.\n\nOn the 2nd, it is just 1.0° from Zubenelgenubi (alpha Librae).\n\nOn the 13th, it lies 0.8° south of Sabik (eta Ophiuchi), and on the 17th, it is 1.0° south of Messier 16 in Serpens.\n\nThe comet is nearest to Earth on the 19th, at a distance of 0.261 au, during which time it is moving at a rate of 4.7° per day\n\n**C/2025 A6 Lemmon**\n\nComet C/2025 A6 Lemmon is visible in the northern sky during October.\n\nOn the 6th and 7th, it is located close to Tania Australis (mu Ursae Majoris), the southern star of the middle pair of the Three Leaps of the Gazelle asterism. This part of the sky sets early in the evening, but is once again easy to view in the northeast after 1:00am. The comet may be visible in binoculars, at about magnitude 8.",

This month, we’ve got a fantastic mix of planets, deep sky objects, and even a rare comet to chase. Whether you’re a casual stargazer enjoying the view with binoculars, a telescope enthusiast hunting planets and nebulae, or an astrophotographer capturing the wonders above, there’s plenty to see and explore. From bright planets like Saturn and Mercury to stunning deep sky gems like the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Helix Nebula, October promises plenty of celestial highlights to keep your nights busy.\n\n**Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN**\n\nThis month brings a rare visitor from the outer Solar System: Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, which reaches its closest approach on October 19th, just 0.261 AU from Earth. Last seen in the inner Solar System over 20,000 years ago.\n\nImage Credit: Mike Kane\n\nAfter perihelion on September 12, it developed a striking 5° corkscrew-shaped ion tail visible in photographs. That’s about the length of 10 Full Moons! Currently around magnitude 6, it’s visible with binoculars low on the western horizon just after sunset. Look near Mars and Spica in Virgo to help spot it. As it approaches Earth, it may brighten to magnitude 4, possibly making it visible to the naked eye under dark skies.. This closest approach is due to happen on the 19... th of October, so pencil in the days between the 18 th till the 21 st, as that will hopefully be one of the best opportunities this year to observe a comet. The comet will continue moving through Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius before fading in early November.\n\nAnd since comets can surprise us with sudden changes in brightness or appearance, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN. Look out for an updated video and article from us right before the best viewing nights so you’ll know exactly what to expect and how to spot it.\n\n**Mercury**\n\nThis month, we’ve also got the 2\n\nnd best opportunity of the year to observe Mercury, as it reaches its greatest elongation on the 29 th of October. This is when Mercury reaches it’s greatest distance in the sky from the Sun and makes it the best time to observe the planet.\n\nThe greatest elongation of the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is kind of like their version of opposition. It’s not quite the same, as it’s not when the planet is at it’s largest, but it represents the best opportunity to observe the planet, as it signifies when the planet appears to be the farthest distance form the sun in our sky.... If you don’t have an opportunity to observe on exactly the 29\n\nth, don’t worry! While planetary opposition and elongation events are typically given as just one date, the truth is that while this date represents the absolute peak, observing up to a week before or after is often 90% as good! So don’t think you’ve missed out, you haven’t!\n\n**Saturn**\n\nSpeaking of opposition, while Saturn’s opposition has already passed, secretly we actually think now may be a better time to observe. Why? Because while Saturn is ever so slightly smaller than last month, it’s rising earlier in the night, making it easier to observe for those of us keen to maintain a reasonable bedtime!\n\nWhile the best viewing window is still a little late, between 10 and 12pm, you’ll still get great views of the planet anytime after sunset, and Saturn should be fairly easy to spot in the Northeastern area of the sky.\n\n**Neptune**\n\nOnce again Neptune joins us alongside Saturn in the Sky. If you’ve got a scope big enough (we’d typically recommend and aperture of 6 inches or larger), and you can See Saturn in the sky, then you’ll be able to spot Neptune. There’s not much worth looking at in it’s own right, but if you’re already observing Saturn, you may as well turn your scope to the furthest planet in the Solar system.... Like Saturn, Neptune is best observed between 10-12pm, but you’ll be able to see it anytime after sunset.\n\nIf you’re up late, this month also represents a good time to have a look at Uranus. Again if you’ve got the aperture, you’ll see a tiny grey-blue disk. This month it’s really only for the most dedicated planet hunters, as to have a good view of it, you’ll need to be up between 1-3am, as that’s when it’s best positioned for observing in the sky.... ###\n\n**Uranus**\n\n**Deep Sky Objects This Month**\n\n**The Small Magellanic Cloud/SMC (NGC 292)**\n\nThe main attraction this month is one of the gems of the Southern sky, The Small Magellanic cloud. While it doesn’t take up as much of the sky as it’s cousin the Large Magellanic cloud (more on this incredible object come January), there’s nothing Small about this cloud of stars, as it stretches 4 degrees across in the sky (that’s 8 moons across!).\n\nImage Credit: ESO/VISTA VMC\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud, or SMC for short is a satellite galaxy of the Milkyway, meaning the SMC orbits the Milky way much in a similar way to how the Moon orbits the Earth! It’s exclusively visible to us in the southern hemisphere, and is easily one of the gems of the southern sky.\n\nThe SMC is visible to the naked eye from dark sites with little light pollution, and in fact is one of the furthest objects visible with the naked eye, at a distance of 200,000 light years away. Up the magnification and light gathering with a pair of Binoculars and the SMC will stand out even more, and you’ll also be able to make out some of the details of the galaxy itself. Up the Magnification and light gathering even more with a large telescope, and individual features within the SMC become resolvable.... Another great target this month is NGC 7293, the Helix Nebula. Often also known by the much more dramatic name, the Eye of God Nebula, the Helix Nebula is one of the closest Planetary Nebula to Earth, which makes it one of the rare planetary Nebula in the sky large enough to make out considerable detail through a telescope, as well as being large enough to be a great target astrophotography target for small refractors and Smart telescopes.\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nThrough the eyepiece, you’ll see an eye shape staring right back, and you’ll see more details the darker your sky, and if you have a UHC filter like this one to boost contrast: https://bintel.com.au/products/astronomik-uhc-filter.\n\nPlanetary nebulae like the Helix are formed during the final stages of a medium-sized star’s life. When stars similar in size to our Sun exhaust the fuel in their cores, they shed their outer layers into space, creating an expanding shell of glowing gas. The exposed hot core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation that excites the surrounding gas, causing it to shine in the striking colours we see in photographs. Planetary nebulae aren’t uncommon in the galaxy, but the Helix is special because it’s one of the closest and brightest, making its structure and details much easier to observe.... The Helix Nebula is another quintessentially Southern object. While it is technically observable from the Northern Hemisphere, they don’t get to see it quite like we do, as we get to see it rise right overhead in the night sky.\n\nYou’ll find the Helix nebula in the constellation Aquarius, and it’s best observed between 8 to 10pm, when its at its highest in the night sky.\n\nAnd that brings an end to this month’s guide to the night sky. October offers an incredible variety of observing opportunities for Southern Hemisphere stargazers. From the bright planets like Saturn, Mercury, and Neptune, to a rare visitor from the outer Solar System in Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, there’s something for every type of observer, no matter if you’re up late hunting faint outer planets or enjoying a relaxed evening spotting a comet low on the horizon. The deep sky is equally rewarding, with the Small Magellanic Cloud and its internal treasures like NGC 346, as well as the Helix Nebula, giving both visual observers and astrophotographers stunning targets to explore. With clear skies, dark horizons, and a mix of familiar and extraordinary objects, October is shaping up to be a month that truly showcases the richness of our southern night sky.",

              "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude. Located inside the border are the cardinal directions and their intermediate points. To find stars, hold the map overhead and orient it so one of the labels matches the direction you’re facing. The stars above the map’s horizon now match what’s in the sky.\n\nThe all-sky map shows how the sky looks at:\n\n10 p.m. October 1\n\n9 p.m. October 15\n\n8 p.m. October 31\n\nPlanets are shown at midmonthOctober2025-SouthernHemisphereDownload",

It is defined as the closest Full Moon to autumnal (fall) equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAs well as being named after the harvest season in the northern half of the globe, the moonrise times around Full Moon at the autumnal equinox are favorable to getting in the harvest. This is because the difference in the time between moonrise from one night to the next becomes\n\n**less than the average of 50 minutes**. The result is that, for **several nights in a row, there’s extra moonlight in the evenings**. Historically, this gave farmers more time to harvest crops.\n\nThe opposite takes effect in the Southern Hemisphere around the September equinox with\n\n**more** than 50 minutes between moonrise from one day to the next around the Full Moon.... ## Two Meteor Showers in October\n\nMeteors, or shooting stars, are the bright streaks of light that occur when a meteoroid—a rock in space—hits our atmosphere and burns up. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid.\n\nOctober boasts two meteor showers: the\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaking around October 8–9, and the **Orionid meteor shower** peaking around October 20–21. The bad news is that the glare from the bright Full Moon will reduce the number of Draconids that are visible this year. The good news is that the Orionids peak close to New Moon, when the night sky is at its darkest.\n\nThe origin of the Draconids is the dust trail left by comet\n\n**21P/Giacobini-Zinner**. Meanwhile, the Orionids have a more famous parent body: **Halley’s Comet**. Have a look at our tips for watching meteor showers.\n\n## Coral Spawning Follows October Full Moon\n\nIn the days after Full Moon in October and November, corals in Australia’s\n\n**Great Barrier Reef** simultaneously release bundles of eggs and sperm into the sea. This phenomenon is called **coral spawning**.\n\nThe event only happens at night, and its timing hinges on a number of factors including Moon phase, water temperatures, salinity levels, and the length of day.\n\nIn the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the inshore reefs usually spawn in\n\n**October**; the outer reefs tend to spawn during **November** or **December**. Meanwhile at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Texas and Louisiana in the USA, coral spawning typically happens after the **August** Full Moon.... ## Mercury Makes a Bright Appearance\n\nMercury shines bright on October 29 as it reaches its\n\n**greatest elongation east**. In general, the days on either side of greatest elongations are the best time to catch the innermost planet in our solar system.\n\nBecause Mercury is small and lies close to the Sun, it can be a challenge to observe. But at greatest elongation east, there is a chance to see it with the naked eye soon after sunset.\n\nAnd the elusive Mercury tends to favor one or other of the hemispheres—this time stargazers in the\n\n**Southern Hemisphere** get the best view.\n\nThere will be a close approach of Mercury and Mars on\n\n**October 20**, seen here from Sydney, Australia, as the two planets set.\n\nAnd on\n\n**October 23**, the Waxing Crescent Moon will join Mercury and Mars—as seen here in Sydney at around 20:15 (8:15 pm) local time.\n\n**But beware:** Do not try to observe objects close to the Sun while any part of the Sun is above the horizon. Never point binoculars or a telescope in the direction of the Sun—it **can cause permanent eye damage**.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Which planets are in the night sky tonight?\n\nOur Interactive Night Sky Map gives the rise and set times for the planets in your town or city.... ## How many planets are there?\n\nAccording to the latest definition, there are 8 planets in our solar system.\n\n## How long does it take to get to Venus?\n\nA typical journey time is around four or five months.",

Email Greg your space questions and he might answer them in the next edition.**\n\nWelcome to WTOP’s monthly feature, “What’s up in the sky?” Each month it features the best the sky has to offer stargazers regarding the moon, planets and stars. Space-related events that might interest you taking place in the D.C. area are included as well.\n\nLet’s get to the sky for October 2025!\n\n**Must-see sky sights for October**\n\nDuring October 2025, Venus continues to be the “Morning Star” in the east before dawn, albeit lower in the sky but still bright. The beautiful and bright winter constellations keep Venus celestial company making for a wondrous sky sight. The moon joins up with Venus too for a must-see sky sight.\n\nThe zodiacal light will be visible in the eastern pre-dawn sky for about two weeks starting on the 19th.\n\nThe Orionid Meteor Shower will happen on the night of Oct. 20-21.\n\n**Star of the month:** **Algol **\n\nIn October, be on the lookout for Algol — the “Demon Star” — so named because of its regular change in brightness. Algol is a variable star that undergoes very regular intervals between its maximum and minimum brightness. You can use this tool to determine when Algol will be at its dimmest for several hours.... It is quite intriguing to watch the star change brightness. You can try imaging this process as well with your camera/smartphone.\n\n**Highlights of the month**\n\nOn Oct. 1 in the southwest, the center and brightest part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, is visible for a few hours after dark before it sets. You need a dark sky site and a moonless night to see the Milky Way at its best.\n\nAs October begins, the Summer Triangle is high overhead with the Milky Way running through it as it flows across the sky to the northeast. As the night heads into the hours before dawn, the “Winter Milky Way” is visible in the southeast to the northwest. You can see the Milky Way with a smartphone and/or camera by taking time exposures. For the best results, use a tripod.\n\n**Oct. 4:** International Observe the Moon Night is on this night. Check out the website for information on events, and of course, the moon!\n\n**Oct. 5:** As it gets dark, Saturn and the almost full moon rise in the east — a mere two degrees apart.\n\n**Oct. 6:** The full harvest supermoon is at 11:47 p.m. Eastern Time and rises at sunset in the East. This is the first full supermoon of 2025 and the largest and brightest full moon of 2025. Should be a grand sight at sunset! Get your smartphone/camera ready.... **Oct. 9:** Starting at 11:30 p.m. and lasting for about 2.5 hours, the bright moon passes through the Pleiades star cluster late in the evening covering, or occulting, some of the stars. Binoculars will enhance the view.\n\n**Oct. 19:** A must see in the pre-dawn sky in the east is the very old, waning crescent moon with Earthshine joining up with Venus at just four degrees apart. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.\n\n**Oct. 19:** While looking at the moon and Venus, be on the lookout for the zodiacal light. For about two weeks, it will be visible in the northern hemisphere in the eastern pre-dawn sky, and for the southern hemisphere in the west after sunset. You will need a dark sky site and clear horizon to see this ghostly pyramid shape in the sky. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.\n\n**Night of Oct. 20-21:** The Orionid Meteor Shower graces our dark, moonless sky. Under these sky conditions, the Orionids exhibit a maximum of about 10-20 meteors per hour.\n\n**Oct. 24:** If you have a straight line horizon in the southwest with no obstructions, at twilight look to the southwest to see the young waxing crescent moon very near Antares. To the lower right and just above the horizon Mercury and dimmer Mars are paired up. You will most likely need binoculars to see this. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.... **The moon**\n\n**Oct. 6-7:** Full harvest supermoon\n\n**Oct.** **13:** Last quarter\n\n**Oct. 21: **New moon\n\n**Oct. 29:** First quarter\n\n**Planets**\n\nMercury is favorable for Southern Hemisphere viewers.\n\nVenus is bright but lower above the eastern horizon before dawn. You can’t miss it.\n\nMars is in the glare of the Sun at dusk.\n\nJupiter rises in the northeast around midnight and is quite bright.\n\nSaturn rises in the east as it gets dark. A great view in a telescope will help see as the rings cast a thin line across the planet.\n\nUranus is in the eastern sky after dark. You need a telescope to best observe the planet, although it is visible in binoculars.\n\nNeptune is in the east as it gets dark. You need a telescope to observe the planet.\n\nPluto is way out there in the solar system and requires taking images through a telescope spaced days apart to hunt it down.\n\n**DC-area events**\n\nInternational Observe the Moon Night has several events around the D.C. region.\n\n**Shenandoah National Park**\n\nShenandoah National Park’s Big Meadows is an excellent dark sky site and there are a variety of activities for you to enjoy throughout the Park. I will be conducting my “Let’s Talk About Space” events, so hope to see you there. If you visit Shenandoah National Park, be sure to check out the rangers’ schedule as they host astronomy events as well.... **NOVAC General Meeting**\n\nGeorge Mason University.

              "snippet": "## Meteor Showers in Early and Late October\n\n### The Draconids – Dragon Meteors Under a Bright Moon\n\nThe\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaks around October 8, 2025, but this year the “Dragon” will have its fire stolen by moonlight. The Draconids are a minor shower (often only ~10 meteors per hour under dark skies [1]), and unfortunately a **full Moon on October 6–7** will flood the night sky with light during the peak [2]. The bright moonlight will wash out all but the brightest Draconid meteors, making them hard to spot. Best chance to catch a few “shooting stars” from Draco’s radiant (near the Dragon’s head in the northern sky) is *as soon as darkness falls* on October 8, before the Moon rises too high [3]. This unusual timing – evening instead of predawn – is because Draconid meteors fly in the early night hours (the shower’s radiant is highest in the sky at nightfall) [4].\n\nWhy bother with a faint shower? The Draconids are infamous for occasional\n\n**outbursts**. In rare years, if Earth passes through a dense clump of debris from the shower’s parent comet (21P/Giacobini-Zinner), the Draconids have surprised observers with hundreds or even thousands of meteors per hour (notably in 1933 and 1946) [5] [6]. Most years are quiet, but the comet did reach perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in March 2025, raising the *possibility* of enhanced activity [7] [8]. “Watch out if the Dragon awakes!” writes one skywatching columnist – that slim chance of a meteor storm keeps many enthusiasts outdoors **even in moonlight** during this shower [9]. While a storm is not expected, keep an eye on the northern sky on October 8–9 just in case. (The Draconids favor observers in the **Northern Hemisphere**; those far south won’t see much, as Draco sits low or below the horizon.)... ## Planetary Highlights and Conjunctions\n\nOctober 2025 offers plenty of planet spotting opportunities. Two bright planets,... **at peak brilliance**in these weeks – astronomers rate it around magnitude –4.5, the brightest it gets all year [48] [49]. **Tip:**after observing Venus and the Moon, scan higher up for fainter **Mars**(see below) and toward the west for Jupiter setting at dawn. **Mercury and Mars at Dusk:**Fleet-footed **Mercury**makes a challenging appearance in late October. On **October 29**, Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation, 23° away from the Sun in the evening sky [50]. This is actually Mercury’s *last*evening apparition of 2025, but it’s not particularly favorable for those in the Northern Hemisphere. Even at maximum separation, Mercury will be low in the bright twilight (it sets shortly after the Sun). Still, around the final week of October, persistent observers might catch Mercury as a faint “star” very low on the **west-southwest horizon**about 30–45 minutes after sunset [51]. Binoculars will help you spot it in the glow. (Observers in the Southern Hemisphere get a slightly better viewing angle, so Mercury will be a bit higher for them.) Intriguingly, **Mars**is also lurking in the same area of sky. Mars, now on the far side of the Sun and very faint, has been sinking into the sunset glare each evening. Around **October 19–23**, Mercury and Mars actually pass each other in what would be a *conjunction*– but this happens so deep in twilight that it’s a tough observation. Mercury is emerging upward from solar conjunction while Mars is vanishing downward into it, so they are both extremely low after sunset [52]. High Point Scientific notes this pairing gives a brief opportunity to see the two planets close together as they trade places relative to the Sun [53]. If you have a **very clear view of the western horizon**on Oct. 19–20, you might attempt a sighting: about 15–20 minutes after sunset, scan for Mercury (the brighter of the two) and see if you can also glimpse dim Mars nearby. Realistically, Mars will likely be invisible without a telescope. By early November, Mars is in conjunction with the Sun and gone. So think of this as **Mercury’s farewell to Mars**in the twilight – a symbolic handoff from one planet to the other.... ## Comets and Cosmic Visitors\n\nComet enthusiasts have much to be excited about in late 2025. October brings the potential for... *(Comet source refs: StarWalk/Starry Night guides [88] [89] [90]; NASA Science [91] [92]; Chron/EarthSky for context [93].)*... ## Auroras on the Rise – Eyes North (or South)!\n\nHigh-latitude skywatchers should stay alert this October for\n\n**aurora borealis** (Northern Lights) or aurora australis (Southern Lights). Solar activity is near its 11-year peak in 2025 – in fact, the Sun’s **solar maximum** is predicted for around July 2025 [94]. That means the Sun is freckled with sunspots and prone to eruptions like flares and coronal mass ejections, which send charged particles hurtling toward Earth. When those particles strike our atmosphere, they trigger the glowing curtains of auroras. The past year has already seen an uptick in auroral displays, and experts say 2025 will continue the trend [95] [96]. *“Aurora activity can often peak after solar maximum, meaning that the next couple of years will likely be an exciting time for aurora watchers,”* notes Dr. Renate Mauland-Hus, an astrophysicist interviewed by TimeandDate [97].\n\nOctober (along with the spring) is traditionally an excellent season for auroras because of the\n\n**equinox effect** – for reasons still being studied, geomagnetic disturbances seem to be more frequent around the equinoxes. With the **nights growing longer** in October, any geomagnetic storm has more hours of darkness to be observed. In practical terms, this means if the Sun belches out a strong Earth-directed solar flare or CME in September/October, auroras could potentially be visible farther from the poles than usual. Already in late 2024 and early 2025, auroras have been sighted at unusually low latitudes during big solar storms [98]. So if you live in **northern Europe, Canada, the northern U.S.** or similarly high latitudes (or the far southern hemisphere equivalents), keep an eye on space weather alerts. A good resource is NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center aurora forecasts or local observatory announcements.... While not a scheduled “event” like an eclipse, an auroral outbreak can be one of the most awe-inspiring skywatching experiences. Imagine curtains of green and purple light dancing on the horizon or overhead – it’s worth braving a cold night if an alert goes out. Even weaker geomagnetic activity can produce a diffuse green glow low in the north. City dwellers might not see much, but under dark rural skies the aurora can be stunning.\n\n**Bottom line:** 2025 is shaping up to be a top-notch aurora year, and **October’s aurora outlook is promising** due to the active Sun. As one astronomy site put it, *“With the Sun at solar maximum, 2025 promises more chances to witness incredible displays of the northern and southern lights.”* [99] So, if you’re in the auroral zone, be ready to “look up” on short notice when the solar wind delivers a geomagnetic surprise.\n\n*(Aurora source refs: TimeandDate [100], NOAA forecasts, Space.com solar cycle outlook [101].)*\n\n**Further Resources:** For more detailed guidance on these events, check out NASA’s monthly *“What’s Up”* skywatching video series [102], which often covers planetary positions and moon phases. Astronomy and space news sites like **Space.com** and **EarthSky** provide up-to-date observing tips and charts for meteor showers and conjunctions. Many national observatories (e.g., the **Royal Observatory Greenwich** or **U.S. Naval Observatory**) post monthly sky highlights on their websites, tailored to different regions. And if you plan to photograph the sky, don’t forget to consult aurora alerts or meteor shower live streams (the Virtual Telescope Project, for example, often hosts live feeds of celestial events [103]).... With a little planning, October 2025 could be an unforgettable month of skywatching. From the eerie\n\n**Draconid meteors**under an autumn sky, to the crisp mornings with **Venus and the crescent Moon**, to the spectacle of a **Harvest supermoon**, there’s a bounty of cosmic wonders to enjoy. So bundle up, find a dark sky if you can, and **enjoy the show** – the universe is putting on one nightly above us.

              "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## Filmography\n|Year|Title|Role|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|2018|*Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*|Herself|Contestant; winner|\n|2019|*Mani*|Jade|Main role (season 4)|\n|2020|*The Drew Barrymore Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Tom Green, Tabitha Brown\"|\n|2020|*Polly Pocket*|Herself (voice)|2 episodes|\n|2021|*Attaway General*|Jade|Episode: \"Difference Of Opinion\"|\n|2022|*The Tiny Chef Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Snap Pea Stir Fry\"|\n|2022|*Hell's Kitchen: Battle of the Ages*|Herself|Episode: \"Clawing Their Way to the Top\"|\n|2025|*Sneaks*|Sky (voice)| |\n\n## See also\n- Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n## References",

We want to push the level of sports and break boundaries. And we all want to have a lot of fun,” says Sky.\n\n### “We all want to do our best. We want to push the level of sports and break boundaries. And we all want to have a lot of fun.”\n\n– Sky Brown\n\nWhen asked how she and her friends are different from past generations of skaters, Sky says, “We have a lot of energy to skate for hours and hours. And when we finish skating, we don’t chill. We just play something else.”\n\nWhether it’s dancing or skating or surfing, Sky knows no limits, and she’s taking her generation to the top with her. “I love to prove people wrong and show that age or size just does not matter for skateboarders,” she says. “I want to show the world that if you believe in yourself and just go for it, you can do anything.”\n\n### “We have a lot of energy to skate for hours and hours.

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... 's nearest neighbor, the moon. We start off the month of October finding out that\n{ts:137} the moon is moving on from its waxing phase to a beautiful full phase on Monday, October the 6th. Now, many of\n{ts:146} you have heard of a harvest moon. And what is a harvest moon? It's the full moon that lies closest to the date of\n{ts:153} the autumnal equinox or the beginning of fall. Fall began, as many of you might know, back on September the 21st. So,\n{ts:162} the closest full moon to it would wind up being in early October. So, that date happens to be on the 6th at 11:48 p.m.\n{ts:172} Eastern Daylight Time. So, a quick history of the harvest moon. Why is it called that? In days when we were much\n{ts:179} more of an agricultural society and with crop you know crops being at the plentiful time for harvesting\n{ts:187} the light of the moon the full moon would help farmers to harvest crops. But astronomically this particular full moon\n{ts:194} the harvest moon rises very short shortly that is after sunset. So simple English we find out that this moon would... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

              "snippet": "# From streets to stadiums: Sky Brown, the youngest Olympic Medallist\n\nEmmy Schouten\n\nSky Brown (16) is one of the most talented skateboarders at this years Olympics. After her bronze medal in Tokyo, Sky is hungry for more. We’ll show you her journey to the Paris Olympics!\n\nMulti-talented\n\nSky Brown is half-British half-Japanese! Born in Miyazaki, her original name is Sukai Buraun (スカイ). Her dad Stuart is British, making here eligible to represent the UK on the Olympics. But he moved to the US before she was born. Sky spends half the year in Japan and the other half in the United States for school. She knows how to keep herself busy. If she’s not skateboarding, you can find her surfing, following guitar lessons or doing some jiu jitsu. Especially surfing is one of her big talents. Her original plan was to compete in\n\n*both* skateboarding and surfing at the Paris Olympics. She failed to qualify at the World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico. Despite not hitting her goal, everybody is super proud. And she’ll definitely try again for the 2028 Olympics ;). Her skateboarding career is the most successful yet. Sky started out with some YouTube tutorials and never had a coach. You can find her practicing in Huntington Beach LA. Sometimes she is joined by 3-time gold snowboarding medallist Shaun White who lives just around the corner.... Fun fact: Did you know that know that Sky won\n\n*Dancing with The Stars; Juniors* in 2018? Prizes\n\nAt just 9-years old, Sky participated in the Vans US Open. The youngest ever to do so! One year later, she became a professional skateboarder, again the youngest ever to do so ;). After her professional debut the prizes started coming. Sky won bronze and gold on the World Championships, two gold medals on the X Games, and silver and gold on the Dew Tour. But her best achievement was at the Tokyo Olympics. It was the year skateboarding debuted on the Olympics. Sky immediately took home bronze. At 13 years old, this made her the youngest UK Olympic medallist ever.\n\nA big inspiration\n\nHer skateboarding achievements inspire girls all over the globe. She became an instant role model. With partnerships from Nike, shoe and skate collaborations, Sky created her own brand. People come up to her wearing her helmet or using her skateboard. It pushes her to be the best version of herself everyday. Her message is clear: don’t care what people think. Everybody just has one life and you can’t let anybody stop you from what you want to do. It is her dream to inspire girls. Not even just in skateboarding, but whatever they want to do. This “Sky Brown-effect” is huge in the UK. In the last 5 years, skateboarding in London grew with 800%! A major part of this is girls hitting the streets after Sky’s Olympic performance.... No pressure\n\nEven with all eyes on her, Sky feels no pressure. Skateboarding is all about fun for her. She never sees it as practicing, it is her happy-place. Skating is her “playground”, and this year La Concorde in Paris will be hers. See her in action on August 6!",

My mind when I skate is just about having fun and showing my best.\n\n\"I like to skate beautifully and hopefully I can do that and show my dance routine.\"... ### Ad content | Stream Sky Sports on NOW\n\n**Stream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

So, I think we're in a good mental space. The practice sessions definitely help adjusting on the kind of surfaces that you play. We are in good shape.

Nitish Reddy makes his debut and we're going with three fast bowlers and three all-rounders.”... Mitchell Marsh said, “We're going to bowl first. It looks like a pretty good wicket, hopefully it's hard and fast. There's a little bit of moisture around, so hopefully we can make the most of that today. It's always a huge honour to captain the country, but to do it in front of a somewhat home crowd, it's always exciting. (Preparation) It's been great. The guys got in on Wednesday. We've had three great days of training. It's always a big build-up, Australia versus India and what's going to be a huge summer for Australian cricket. So, hopefully we can get off to a good start. (Morale) It's great. We've got some good young players, lots of power, so it's going to be hopefully exciting and entertaining. Seven batters, one keeper and four bowlers… six batters?

              "snippet": "# Welcome To The ‘Top Chef’ of Surfboard Shaping\n\nEight men face off at the 2025 Boardroom Show — Eric Arakawa deems Dan Mann victorious.\n\n**Ideas are fleeting, but carrying them out requires perseverance, stones and sheer bloody-mindedness.**\n\nOne fruit of such labour is The Boardroom Show, an annual celebration of surfboards and their shapers that’s just completed its 24th edition at the Del Mar, CA, Fairgrounds.\n\n“The idea came from the Clark Foam closure in ’05,” says Boardroom Show’s founder Scott Bass. “There was a lot of shapers that I looked up to who didn’t have anywhere to put their wares.’\n\n“Retailers were filling their brick and mortars with overseas stuff—which I don’t blame them for—but in the meantime, the local shaper was getting left out. These guys are crucial to our culture, so I thought we had to do something to showcase them. That’s kind of the nexus of the whole deal.”\n\nScott had a dream: a festival of the surfboard that showcased the best of what the world’s rich array of board builders big-and-small had to offer.\n\nClearly, someone had to pay for this thing, so Scott put down his own capital, then decided to start at the top and work his way down. The results were instant and encouraging.... “I called Rusty (Preisendorfer) that first year and said, ‘Rusty, if I do this, will you get a booth?’” Scott explains. “He was like, ‘Yeah you can count on me.’ And then I called Matt Biolos and said, ‘Matt, if I do this, will you get a booth?’ And Matt said, ‘Yes.’ So I had two of the stalwarts of the surfboard industry agree to do it, then it just sort of took off from there.”\n\nWhat’s materialised from that point is far more nuanced than a room full of stacked racks. Clearly a creative romantic, Scott’s baby has morphed into a blend of competition, trade show and celebration, with themes galore. The brand booth set-up is pretty self-explanatory, featuring surfboards, hardware, all things surf — but the competition side is where things really get interesting.\n\nEvery year The Boardroom Show honours a shaper (in the past they’ve had Al Merrick, Simon Anderson, MR, John Bradbury, to name but a few) in their ‘Icons of Foam Shape-Off’ — a competition where board-builders chosen by the iconic shaper have to recreate some of\n\n*their* classic designs, all by hand, under a time limit, for a shot at the crown.... This year is was the legendary Hawaiian shaper Eric Arakawa, and the shapers he chose to recreate his designs were Dan Mann, Todd Proctor, Adam Warden, Chris Christenson, Richie Collins, Barry Van der Meulen Rodolfo Klima, and Allen White, who qualified for winning the shape-off element of the Surf Expo on the east coast.\n\nThe boards in question featured, “A Derek Ho tri-fin from his ’93 World Title winning campaign, a Waimea Bay gun he made for Ronnie Burns in ’86, then the Andy Irons board that he won the Pipe Masters and the World Title on in 2003.” Scott explains. “It’s strictly timed — they get to look at and measure the original board, then their hour and a half starts. Two shapers at a time, side by side like man-on-man heat.”\n\nEric Arakawa then judged the winner, and interestingly it was Dan Mann, who took down Allen White the wildcard in the final.\n\nApart from the ‘Icons of Foam’ there were all sorts of interesting components to The Boardroom Show, like a VIP dinner where eight paying customers got to hang and fine-dine with Eric and guests, and another, more low key shape-off that Scott describes as “The... *British Bake Off* of surfboards.”\n\n“It’s called the ‘Best in Show’ competition, it’s open to any board builder around the world. It’s free, and the public vote on the winner,” Scott says. “All you got to do is build a board and bring it to the show.”\n\nAs with everything Boardroom Show, there’s a theme (this is the\n\n*Bake-Off* Part), and this year Scott told competitors to, “Go make us a fish, but I want you to add wooden accents to the board and include meaningful symbology — maybe it’s your grandfather’s purple heart or your daughter’s astrological sign…”\n\nThe ‘Best in Show’ in 2025 was won by Steve Farwell of Farwell Surboards from Newport Beach, CA, who’ll receive a free booth at the next Boardroom Show for his troubles.\n\nBasically if you nerd-out on high-end surfboards (aka you surf at all), be sure to try get to the 25th instalment of the Boardroom Show.\n\nApart from supporting craftsmen big and small, you’ll be vindicating an idea, which is always a worthwhile pursuit in our books.\n\n*Give them a follow on IG for all Boardroom Show updates.*\n\n**For the three people on whom our sarcasm is lost: Gerry Lopez and Eric Arakawa. *... ## Most Recent\n\n## Welcome To The ‘Top Chef’ of Surfboard Shaping\n\nEight men face off at the 2025 Boardroom Show — Eric Arakawa deems Dan Mann…\n\n## Watch: ‘Feels Like Yesterday’ Starring The Colapinto Bros, Cole Houshmand & San Clemente’s Electric Youth\n\nA Film of the Year contender by Jacob Vanderwork.\n\n## Shane Borland Crowned World’s Best Surf/Skate Crossbreed At Keris Cup\n\n+ Sky Brown dislocates her shoulder, still packs proper Padang tube.\n\n## America’s Greatest East Coast Surf Town Is Disappearing\n\nA story of Atlantic storms, Cold War ghosts and institutional negligence.\n\n## “We Sat On These Concrete Expansion Joints Right Under The Air Section — But For Rasta Robb We Needed A New Marker”\n\nBill Morris + Ryan Heywood tell the story behind 19 unseen frames from the Stab…\n\n## Watch: Craig Anderson in ‘Samudra Spirit Glitters’\n\n\"I feel people can smell the process.

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:385} your shadow by the brilliance of Venus. Now, you may wonder, how could that be? Well, if you're in a snowy field because\n{ts:390} of the whiteness of snow and Venus was, of course, you're staring at it and you turned around under super dark\n{ts:397} conditions, you might get to see your shadow, not just like the moon would cast your shadow or the sun in the\n{ts:403} daytime, but the planet Venus itself, which is quite interesting. So, ladies and gentlemen, a good opportunity now to\n{ts:410} talk about a pair of binoculars. Now, I get this question on the Dr. I experience all the time. And you can\n{ts:415} email me with your questions at just drsky at wabcradio.com.\n{ts:421} I'm there for you to answer questions and no question is foolish. I mean, we get questions and help people out.\n{ts:426} That's what we do to explore the mysteries of the universe. So, a pair of binoculars, let's talk about it for a\n{ts:433} moment. You use both eyes. Hopefully, your eyes are in good health. And even if they... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

              "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024.

've all booked rooms in the city, all the interstate visitors. They're spending money at restaurants. the investment uh from Hong Kong, the investment on the Hong Kong tote went to 99.5 million Hong Kong dollars, which surpassed the previous record of 84\n{ts:323} million Hong Kong dollars, which was invested on the Saudi Cup. Now, the Saudi Cup was important because that's the race that rodic Warrior, of course. So, this went beyond that. Incredible. Here's the race. Darren Flynnel's call of the 2025 20 million Tab Everest\n{ts:341} and we're just about ready to run to the roar of a youthful crowd and they're off in the tab Everest. An overpass begin fast as expected. Caying risings right there and now Mazu is whipping up underneath the pair. Lady Shannondal has got a great spot fourth in front of\n{ts:359} Tempted. Further back to Jolly Star. They're followed then by Jimmy Star is going forward from the wide drawer. Brias's got back in the field followed then by Angel Capital. Jedial and Magic Time. Mazu shows the way. Overpass sits on the outside. Caryang rising two\n{ts:376} lengths away. Third is trucking along and Jimmy keeps him company. Jimmy Star up on the outside followed by Tempted. Lady Shannondoa and Jolly Star gets great cover turning for home. Marzu in front from over pass. Caying rising two lengths away. Then Jimmy Star clear from... $150 with any confidence whatsoever, even though he got to even money. So, in the space between October\n{ts:498} 7 and October 18, David Hayes has elevated that horse, not even back to his best, but back to a a point where he can do this. Yeah, he's just incredible. Um he and he and I wasn't at the trial, but I the vision I\n{ts:515} saw of him at the trial walking around, he was hot, he was bothered. Uh he's just And you know, everyone tells me that he's never trled bad in Hong Kong. So, it was it was a one-off that really well, it even I think it's even scared Zack. He said, \"Well, there's room for improvement.\" I'm sure I'm I'm sure of\n{ts:534} that. Well, you could tell Ronnie, like I said in that interview on Friday that I done with Zach, like he was concerned like and not only about the horse, but about the track conditions as well. Like they were obviously a bit worried and the surface, all the little things that I said, \"Oh, does it bother you?\" He said, \"Yes, it does.\"\n{ts:550} normally Zach would go the other way, you know, and he... {ts:904} line I got to give it to Brown Ethan Brown as well he had a crack at given given it to Zach there but he just wasn't fast enough on the right horse let's talk about David Hayes and um the way he has embraced this journey for everyone uh even when He said, \"I want to take\n{ts:923} Kaying Rising away from the crowd to saddle him up because I think that's what we need to do to have him right.\" He also said, \"But I still want to show him off to the crowd. I still want him to parade. I want everyone to have a look at him and then we'll move him out the back and then we'll saddle him up.\" After he\n{ts:940} settled up, he came back out into that pre- parade and we got another look at him.... {ts:1347} I was I was very happy to see him sit down with you on the Friday. you did a long interview with him which we played on the morning of the Everest and how relaxed he was and how open he was to to still talk about something that he's been talking about for weeks and weeks and weeks. Uh surely he was looking forward to the talk being over and just getting out\n{ts:1364} there and doing it. But he sat down, he was relaxed and he gave you that interview to talk about what he thought of the day coming up tomorrow. Yeah. And like I said, Rads, like with all that pressure, not just all the money and you know, like, but that big buildup, like I said, it's it's a lot of pressure and that\n{ts:1383} those BS like Zack and Huey and even Lukie Nolan for that matter, you know, like to handle that pressure, I'm not even sure I'd be able to do it. You know what I mean? Like he could quite often panic. Like even though he's a front running horse, when he jumped, he jumped well. Obviously overpass outside Mazu underneath him. You watch the overhead shot and he just gives it... 's coming back to scale now. Will you be back? Will you be back next year? Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Don't you worry about that. And we'll get that Twitter guy out of my life and it'll be\n{ts:1627} good fun. Good on you, David. Oh, that Twitter guy. Now, that was the fake news moment. That was the fake news moment. Oh, yeah, baby. He's coming back. So, actually before we move on, have you got the tab Everest market? Let's have the first ladies and gentlemen, here it is. The first market\n{ts:1646} we're going to show you for next year's Everest. I don't keep count how many times we show you this between now and October, whatever, next year. They put up 250 yesterday. They put up 250. Oh, no. He's into 225 already. No. Well, they get their money back if he doesn't come.\n{ts:1666} Back. I think he's coming. Bay Jimmy Jolie. Well, we're just rehashing the the beaten brigade that the two incoming a Bay and Autumn Glow. We'll see what happens. They don't think Tempted went any good yesterday. Well, she... s done 60 interviews this week of probably which 45 or 50 of them were over that\n{ts:1946} conjecture. So, you know, we thought it was funny at first, like, oh, how stupid. And then when it sort of uh took hold and everyone was ringing us from stewards to, you know, the CEO of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, it was just like, guys, this is just a, you know, this is\n{ts:1964} just a hack. So, anyway, you David said a couple of days ago and he said, I thought I'd seen everything in racing. I haven't. So we uh I arrived last Saturday at Rose Hill Gardens and Ronnie said to me, \"This horse is on the first plane back to Hong Kong if these reports are right.\n{ts:1982} It started I mean it really heated up on Sunday but it was talked it was happened on Friday night.\" Yeah, it was going Friday afternoon into the night from all sorts of sources. So it spread like a bush fire and you know what it likes with rumors, they get bigger and bigger and bigger and someone puts their own top spin on it and they've got him, you know, in... 's just playing unbelievably well. You know, maybe the fence wasn't the place to be yesterday if you want to nitpick, but that's that's no problem whatsoever. It's a big track. It's probably better really. It makes them fan and carry on. A few Well, but I don't think we had a leader win all day.\n{ts:2201} Yeah. Uh so hard to lead and win. And Rody, it it makes it even better the job that Michael Wood and Dave Anderson have done with the track because they haven't had the rain. They've had to water it. Yeah. Yeah. And they and and sometimes that can be dangerous and they've got the watering right.\n{ts:2218} That's what I reckon. And then Tim walks the tracks. I listen to Tim. He's a very He's got all the figures. Tim Ryan. Yep. And he says and I agree that they have just the they've got the watering down pat. They're not watering tracks down to start off on soft fives. They you can\n{ts:2235} get so much wrong doing that. Yes. They just put enough in there slowly slowly. I know they've had the weather and we've had rain at the right time of the week all mostly. Mostly yes. But it worked out perfect there on the weekend. Like I was talking to Michael Wood like they considering putting one... 's definitely a PB. Even though he's, you know, in the in the book, he's finished fourth, but that he just run out of his skin there on Saturday. So, as it turned out, it wasn't a bad trial. It was a good trial for everything. It was a nice trial.\n{ts:2392} Well, offline car Ying Mr. Bright Side just got nutted out. It's been a great try. Well, the quote from John O'",

              "snippet": "- Details\n\n- By Native News Online Staff\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON — In addition to articles already covered by Native News Online, here is a roundup of other news released from Washington, D.C. that impacts Indian Country recently. With no concrete discussions underway between congreesional Republicans and Democrats, the federal government shutdown will enter its fourth week on Wednesday with no end in sight.\n\n##### NCAI Strongly Condemns Large-Scale Federal Layoffs Harming Tribal Programs\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) strongly condemns the large-scale reductions in force (RIFs) purportedly resulting from the ongoing government shutdown, which disproportionately impact Tribal programs — particularly those supporting health care, housing, economic development, and education in Native communities.\n\n**Never miss Indian Country’s biggest stories and breaking news.**Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\n\n\"Targeting people who manage and support programs that are the backbone of Tribal communities — our health, our homes, our economic futures, and our children's education — is not just short-sighted, it's an abdication of the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations,\" said NCAI Executive Director Larry Wright, Jr. \"Our communities are not expendable. These actions are a betrayal of the promises made to Tribal Nations, and we will not remain silent as the very infrastructure of our future is dismantled.\"\n\n###### CMS Hosts All Tribes Webinar on the Rural Health Transformation Program\n\nLast week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) hosted an All Tribes Webinar on the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). The RHTP was authorized by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and will invest $50 billion into improving rural health care over the next five years.\n\nThe National Indian Health Board (NIHB) hosted a Tribal caucus to help Tribal leaders, health experts, Tribal organizations, and health professionals prepare for the webinar. During the Tribal caucus, NIHB provided an overview of the RHTP and analyzed its Tribal impacts. You can find the caucus presentation slides here.\n\nTo follow up after the webinar, CMS Division of Tribal Affairs (DTA) circulated the presentation slides.... ##### Medicare Open Enrollment is Underway\n\nMedicare Open Enrollment runs from October 15 through December 7. During this period, beneficiaries can review and make changes to their Medicare coverage for 2026, including switching plans or updating prescription drug coverage. Although under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), special enrollment periods have been changed, members of federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Corporation shareholder can still enroll year-round. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to compare options and ensure their plan meets their current health needs. The changes made during Open Enrollment are effective January 1 of next year. Read about your options and find more information here.\n\n##### Federal Government Goes Paperless for Payments\n\nStarting Sept. 30, the federal government went paperless, which means most federal payments that were made by paper check—including Social Security benefits and tax refunds—will be made electronically.\n\nThe change came as a result of Executive Order (EO) 14247 “Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account” that was signed on March 25, 2024 by President Trump.\n\nIn order to promote public awareness of the Federal Government’s shift to secure electronic payments, the Department of the Treasury has created a new resource page related to EO 14247 at MyMoney.gov/FederalPayments.\n\nThe new page features frequently asked questions about the EO, directions for signing up for electronic payments, and Federal agency contact information where payment recipients can learn more or get help.... #### More Stories Like ThisNative News Weekly (August 25, 2024): D.C. Briefs\n\nUS Presidents in Their Own Words Concerning American Indians\n\nOral History Project Announces 14th Stop in Portland, Oregon: NABS Continues to Gather Crucial Stories Across Indian Country\n\nCheyenne River Youth Project Kicks Off Annual Family Services Membership Drive\n\n**Help us tell the stories that could save Native languages and food traditions**\n\nAt a critical moment for Indian Country, Native News Online is embarking on our most ambitious reporting project yet: \"Cultivating Culture,\" a three-year investigation into two forces shaping Native community survival—food sovereignty and language revitalization.\n\nThe devastating impact of COVID-19 accelerated the loss of Native elders and with them, irreplaceable cultural knowledge. Yet across tribal communities, innovative leaders are fighting back, reclaiming traditional food systems and breathing new life into Native languages. These aren't just cultural preservation efforts—they're powerful pathways to community health, healing, and resilience.\n\nOur dedicated reporting team will spend three years documenting these stories through on-the-ground reporting in 18 tribal communities, producing over 200 in-depth stories, 18 podcast episodes, and multimedia content that amplifies Indigenous voices. We'll show policymakers, funders, and allies how cultural restoration directly impacts physical and mental wellness while celebrating successful models of sovereignty and self-determination.\n\nThis isn't corporate media parachuting into Indian Country for a quick story. This is sustained, relationship-based journalism by Native reporters who understand these communities. It's \"Warrior Journalism\"—fearless reporting that serves the 5.5 million readers who depend on us for news that mainstream media often ignores.\n\n**We need your help right now.** While we've secured partial funding, we're still $450,000 short of our three-year budget. Our immediate goal is $25,000 this month to keep this critical work moving forward—funding reporter salaries, travel to remote communities, photography, and the deep reporting these stories deserve.\n\nEvery dollar directly supports Indigenous journalists telling Indigenous stories. Whether it's $5 or $50, your contribution ensures these vital narratives of resilience, innovation, and hope don't disappear into silence.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. Native languages are being lost at an alarming rate. Food insecurity plagues many tribal communities. But solutions are emerging, and these stories need to be told.\n\n*Support independent Native journalism. Fund the stories that matter.*\n\nLevi Rickert (Potawatomi), Editor & Publisher",

            "snippet": "### National Summary\n\n#### Overall Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening. Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.... #### Labor Markets\n\nEmployment levels were largely stable in recent weeks, and demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors. In most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing weaker demand, elevated economic uncertainty, and, in some cases, increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies. Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities. Nevertheless, labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies. Wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace, and labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.\n\n#### Prices\n\nPrices rose further during the reporting period. Several District reports indicated that input costs increased at a faster pace due to higher import costs and the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions. Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept their selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and in response to pushback from price-sensitive clients. However, there were also reports of firms in manufacturing and retail trades fully passing higher import costs along to their customers. Waning demand in some markets reportedly pushed prices down for some materials, such as steel in the Sixth District and lumber in the Twelfth District.... #### Highlights by Federal Reserve District\n\n##### Boston\n\nEconomic activity expanded slightly, with modest growth in consumer spending. Employment was flat, as both hiring and layoffs increased modestly. Prices increased at a moderate pace, although certain cost pressures intensified. Home sales were flat from a year earlier. The outlook was neutral to cautiously optimistic, but contacts saw mostly downside risks.\n\n##### New York\n\nEconomic activity continued to decline slightly. Employment held steady, and wage growth remained modest. The pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed. Manufacturing activity held steady after a summer uptick. Consumer spending increased modestly, buoyed by mid- to upper-income households. Businesses did not expect activity to increase much in the months ahead.\n\n##### Philadelphia\n\nBusiness activity increased slightly in the current Beige Book period. Employment levels increased slightly, and wages again rose at modest pre-pandemic rates. Prices continued to rise moderately. Activity increased slightly for nonmanufacturers and moderately for manufacturers. Generally, firms expect modest growth over the next six months, but heightened economic uncertainty remains.\n\n##### Cleveland\n\nFourth District business activity was flat in recent weeks, but contacts expected activity to increase modestly in months ahead. Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Contacts said that cost growth remained robust, while their selling prices increased modestly.... ##### Richmond\n\nThe regional economy grew modestly in recent weeks. Consumer spending continued to grow modestly and import activity rose. Manufacturing activity declined slightly and growth in the remaining industries was largely flat. Employment levels were largely unchanged and wage growth remained moderate. Price growth remained moderate, overall, despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector.\n\n##### Atlanta\n\nThe Sixth District economy was unchanged. Employment levels were steady, and wages grew modestly. Prices increased moderately. Consumer spending fell, and leisure travel softened. Home sales declined, and commercial real estate was unchanged. Transportation declined. Manufacturing grew slightly. Energy grew moderately, and agriculture was healthy.\n\n##### Chicago\n\nEconomic activity in the Seventh District was flat. Consumer spending increased modestly; construction and real estate activity increased slightly; employment was flat; nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity; business spending declined slightly; and manufacturing activity declined modestly. Prices rose moderately, wages were up modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\n\n##### St. Louis\n\nEconomic activity and employment levels have remained unchanged since our previous report. Contacts continue to report that immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages. Prices have increased moderately, with contacts reporting that inflation is eroding consumer purchasing power. Banking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report, with overall credit conditions remaining strong. Agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated. The outlook remains slightly pessimistic.... ##### Minneapolis\n\nDistrict economic activity contracted slightly. Labor demand softened, according to firms and job seekers, though wage growth remained moderate. Price increases remained modest, but input price pressures increased. Manufacturing and commercial real estate were flat, but most other sectors contracted. Agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.\n\n##### Kansas City\n\nEconomic activity in the Tenth District fell slightly over the past month. Employment levels declined slightly, and bankers noted consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately. Though activity fell recently, expectations for sales and employment in 2026 were broadly optimistic. Expectations for the pace of price growth in 2026 were similarly above 2025 levels.\n\n##### Dallas\n\nEconomic activity was flat. Service sector activity contracted mildly. Retail sales fell, while the pace of manufacturing output growth moderated. Loan demand grew, but the housing market remained weak, and drilling and well completion activity was flat. Employment dipped, and wage growth was modest. Price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. Outlooks deteriorated with slowing demand, policy uncertainty, and inflation highlighted as the top concerns for businesses.\n\n##### San Francisco\n\nEconomic activity edged down slightly. Employment levels were little changed. Wages grew slightly, and prices rose modestly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreased somewhat while commercial real estate activity was unchanged. Manufacturing and lending activity remained stable. Conditions in consumer and business services were mixed.\n\nNote: This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected on or before October 6, 2025. This document summarizes comments received from contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.",

            "snippet": "#### While the near-term forecast is revised up modestly, global growth remains subdued, as the newly introduced policies slowly come into focus\n\nThe global economy is adjusting to a landscape reshaped by new policy measures. Some extremes of higher tariffs were tempered, thanks to subsequent deals and resets. But the overall environment remains volatile, and temporary factors that supported activity in the first half of 2025—such as front-loading—are fading.\n\nAs a result, global growth projections in the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) are revised upward relative to the April 2025 WEO but continue to mark a downward revision relative to the pre-policy-shift forecasts. Global growth is projected to slow from 3.3 percent in 2024 to 3.2 percent in 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, with advanced economies growing around 1.5 percent and emerging market and developing economies just above 4 percent. Inflation is projected to continue to decline globally, though with variation across countries: above target in the United States—with risks tilted to the upside—and subdued elsewhere.\n\nRisks are tilted to the downside. Prolonged uncertainty, more protectionism, and labor supply shocks could reduce growth. Fiscal vulnerabilities, potential financial market corrections, and erosion of institutions could threaten stability.\n\nPolicymakers are urged to restore confidence through credible, transparent, and sustainable policies. Trade diplomacy should be paired with macroeconomic adjustment. Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt. Central bank independence should be preserved. Efforts on structural reforms should be redoubled. As Chapter 2 shows, past actions to improve policy frameworks have served countries well. As Chapter 3 demonstrates, industrial policy may have a role, but full consideration should be given to opportunity costs and trade-offs involved in its use.... ###### Chapter 1: Global Prospects and Policies\n\nGlobal growth is projected to slow and growth prospects remain dim, as the world adjusts to a landscape marked by greater protectionism and fragmentation. Global headline inflation is expected to decline further but remain above target in some countries. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Prolonged uncertainty and escalation of protectionist measures may further hinder growth. Larger-than-expected shocks to labor supply could reduce growth, especially in economies facing aging populations and skill shortages. Fiscal vulnerabilities and financial market fragilities may interact with rising borrowing costs and increased rollover risks for sovereigns. An abrupt repricing of tech stocks could threaten macrofinancial stability. Pressure on the independence of key economic institutions could undermine sound economic decision making. To navigate a global economy in flux, policymakers should restore confidence through credible, transparent, and sustainable policies\n\n###### Chapter 2: Emerging Market Resilience: Good Luck or Good Policies?\n\nEmerging markets have shown remarkable resilience to risk-off shocks in recent years. While favorable external conditions—\n\n*good luck*—contributed to this resilience, improvements in policy frameworks— *good policies*—played a critical role in bolstering the capacity of emerging markets to withstand risk-off shocks. Improvements in monetary and fiscal policy implementation and credibility have reduced reliance on foreign exchange interventions, with central banks less sensitive to fiscal interference and holding sway over domestic borrowing conditions. Looking ahead, countries with robust frameworks face easier policy trade-offs and are better positioned to navigate risk-off episodes. In contrast, economies with weaker frameworks risk de-anchoring inflation expectations and larger output losses if monetary tightening is delayed, especially when persistent price pressures emerge. In these settings, costly foreign exchange interventions offer only temporary relief and are less necessary when policy frameworks are sound.... ###### Chapter 3: Industrial Policy: Managing Trade-Offs to Promote Growth and Resilience\n\nCountries are increasingly using industrial policy to reshape their economies by supporting strategic sectors and firms. Motivations include boosting productivity, reducing reliance on imports—especially in energy—and enhancing resilience. Industrial policies can help jump-start domestic industries, but their efficacy is sensitive to sector-specific characteristics that can be hard to determine in advance. And industrial policies present trade-offs. Onshoring production in a strategic sector might lead to higher consumer prices for a prolonged period. And the fiscal cost of industrial policy can be substantial at a time of elevated debt and constrained public finances. Even when sector-level outcomes are positive, industrial policy can generate negative cross-sector spillovers and reduce overall productivity by drawing resources inefficiently away from sectors that are not targeted. Effective industrial policy requires careful targeting and implementation, strong institutions, complementary structural reforms and sound macroeconomic policy.\n\n#### Publications\n\n\n\nJuly 2025\n\n- Global Imbalances in a Shifting World\n\n\n\nRegional Economic Outlooks\n\n- Latest Issues\n\n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\nFinance & Development\n\n- Stablecoins and the Future of Finance",

            "snippet": "[10] [11]. **Three Featured Comets.**October 2025 is unusually rich in cometary activity. Interstellar **Comet 3I/ATLAS**(discovered July 2025) will reach perihelion Oct 30, at about 1.4 AU from the Sun [12]. Recent analyses by astronomers (Avi Loeb and others) estimate its nucleus is **>3 miles wide**, with a mass of ~33 billion tons [13]. (Importantly, 3I/ATLAS stays far from Earth – closest approach ~1.8 AU – and will pass behind the Sun, reappearing in December [14] [15].) Two other comets, **SWAN (C/2025 R2)**and **Lemmon (C/2025 A6)**, will brighten in the sky. SWAN reaches its closest Earth approach (~0.26 AU) on Oct 19 but remains very dim without a telescope [16]. Comet **Lemmon**rounds closest to Earth (~0.60 AU) on Oct 21, and forecasts suggest it could brighten to ~magnitude +3 by perihelion on Nov 8. This implies naked-eye visibility under dark skies; Universe Magazine notes that around Oct 21 Lemmon “will be clearly visible even to the naked eye”... ## A Rare October Super Harvest Moon\n\nOctober’s full Moon (Oct 6 local dates) coincides with lunar perigee (closest approach), making it a\n\n**supermoon** – the largest of 2025 [28] [29]. It is also the **Harvest Moon**, by definition the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. However, in 2025 the timing is unusual: unlike most years when the Harvest Moon falls in September, this year it slips into October. *Space.com* explains that “the full moon of Oct. 6… will also carry the title ‘Harvest Moon’” because it actually lies closer to the Sept 23 equinox than September’s full moon [30]. According to *Space.com* expert Joe Rao, “October’s full moon will be the largest and brightest Moon of the year,” and the first supermoon since Nov 2024 [31]. This late Harvest Moon is the latest since 1987 [32].\n\nAstronomers emphasize that the visual effect is subtle: although the Moon will be ~6–14% larger and ~13–30% brighter than average\n\n[33] [34], most people see little actual size change. (The perceived “Moon illusion” makes it look even larger near the horizon [35] [36].) Still, the sight of a bright orange Moon high among the stars is a photogenic treat. Skywatchers in North America will see the Full Moon on the evening of Oct 6, with peak illumination at 11:48 p.m. EDT.... ## Meteor Showers: Draconids & Orionids\n\nOctober brings two named meteor showers, but the real highlight is the Orionids. The\n\n**Draconids** (from Comet 21P/Giacobini–Zinner) peak around Oct 8–9. Unfortunately, this coincides with the super-Harvest Moon, so apart from occasional very bright meteors the shower will largely be washed out by moonlight [37]. National Geographic notes that in 2025 “all but the brightest meteors will likely be drowned out by moonlight” for the Draconids [38]. Despite their low predicted rate (Zenithal Hourly Rate ~5) and the lunar interference, the Draconids are known for erratic outbursts in some years – so it’s still worth a quick look if skies are clear.\n\nThe\n\n**Orionid** meteor shower, by contrast, will be truly unmissable this year. The Orionids — debris from Halley’s Comet — are active Oct 2–Nov 12, but peak activity is expected the night of Oct 21–22 [39] [40]. Crucially, the new Moon on Oct 21 means almost no moonlight during the peak. Both EarthSky and the Planetary Society note that 2025 offers “ideal conditions” for the Orionids. According to the Planetary Society, the Orionids are normally a “medium-low strength shower producing up to 20 meteors per hour from a dark site,” and this year “moonlight will not interfere with observing” thanks to the new Moon [41]. EarthSky concurs: “in 2025, the Orionid meteor shower should rain down its greatest number of meteors on the morning of October 21. The moon won’t interfere.” [42]. Space.com’s Anthony Wood advises skywatchers to “look up on the nights between Oct. 2 to Nov. 12 to see tiny shards of Halley’s Comet strike Earth’s atmosphere” [43], especially around the peak. Under clear, dark skies at peak, observers can reasonably hope to count **10–20 Orionids per hour**, many leaving long glowing trails or occasional fireballs [44] [45]. The best viewing is after midnight, facing Orion’s radiant in the southeast, with patience and a reclining chair to scan the sky.... Meanwhile, two long-period comets discovered earlier in 2025 will be visible in binoculars or better.\n\n**Comet SWAN (C/2025 R2)** was found in SOHO images and passes perihelion Sept 2025. By mid-October it begins appearing in the western evening sky, reaching closest Earth approach (0.26 AU) on Oct 19. However, forecasts indicate SWAN will likely remain rather faint (around 6–7th magnitude), requiring telescopes for casual observers [54].\n\nThe comet most promising to backyard skywatchers is\n\n**C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)**. Discovered Jan 2025 by the Mount Lemmon Survey, it has been steadily brightening. In late September southern observers were already seeing it in binoculars. Lemmon comes closest on Oct 21 (about 0.60 AU from Earth). Current models predict it could reach a visual magnitude of roughly +3 by that time – bright enough to be “clearly visible even to the naked eye” under dark skies [55]. (By November 8, at perihelion, it might brighten further.) As Universe Magazine explains: *“According to current forecasts, [Lemmon’s] brightness at [Oct 21] will reach +3.1, which means it will be clearly visible even to the naked eye”* [56]. Comet Lemmon will move quickly across northern constellations, so charts or apps will help track it; by late October it may appear low in the northwest after sunset. But as comet expert David Levy reminds us, **“comets are like cats: they have tails, and they do precisely what they want.”** [57] Amateur astronomers will be watching closely to see if Lemmon lives up to predictions.... [64] – offering a great opportunity to spot M31 by eye or binoculars. Later in the month the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) climbs high (best around Oct 15) [65]. With the new moon on Oct 21 and crisp autumn air, late October is ideal for binoculars or small telescopes: skywatching guides note that “the nights of Oct 20/21” will be a great chance to combine meteor-hunting with searches for these galaxies and nebulae [66].\n\nFinally, the fall sky brings the familiar W-shape of Cassiopeia and the Perseids’ Double Cluster into early evening view. All October, darker skies and cooler weather mean sharper, steadier viewing. Skywatchers are advised to get away from city lights, dress warmly, and give their eyes time to adapt. As\n\n*Astro Photons* advises, use the new-moon window (Oct 20–23) for deep-sky hunting, but “enjoy the brighter planets and Orionids throughout the month” [67] [68].\n\nOctober 2025 promises a cornucopia of sky sights. Between the Harvest supermoon, dual meteor showers, and multiple comets, there’s plenty for both casual observers and seasoned astronomers to enjoy. The combined insights of professional skywatchers and astrophiles remind us to look up – there are guaranteed\n\n*“epic astronomical events”* to see [69] [70].\n\n**Sources:** National Geographic [71] [72]; Space.com [73] [74]; Planetary Society [75]; *Universum* magazine [76] [77]; EarthSky [78]; NASA science releases [79] [80]; ABC News [81] [82]; local astronomy reporting [83] [84].",

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... 's nearest neighbor, the moon. We start off the month of October finding out that\n{ts:137} the moon is moving on from its waxing phase to a beautiful full phase on Monday, October the 6th. Now, many of\n{ts:146} you have heard of a harvest moon. And what is a harvest moon? It's the full moon that lies closest to the date of\n{ts:153} the autumnal equinox or the beginning of fall. Fall began, as many of you might know, back on September the 21st. So,\n{ts:162} the closest full moon to it would wind up being in early October. So, that date happens to be on the 6th at 11:48 p.m.\n{ts:172} Eastern Daylight Time. So, a quick history of the harvest moon. Why is it called that? In days when we were much\n{ts:179} more of an agricultural society and with crop you know crops being at the plentiful time for harvesting\n{ts:187} the light of the moon the full moon would help farmers to harvest crops. But astronomically this particular full moon\n{ts:194} the harvest moon rises very short shortly that is after sunset. So simple English we find out that this moon would... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

But Sky Brown’s attitude toward her many achievements can be summed in one sunny, simple line at the top of her Instagram page: “Do it ’cause you love it!”.\n\nSky is a new breed of athlete: a radical optimist who plays in pursuit of a feeling, rather than a win. It’s an attitude shared by a generation that, in a shift from ones past, views sport as a form of play rather than competition.\n\nFor Sky and her skate friends, the thrill of getting better is part of the appeal.\n\n**“**We all want to do our best. We want to push the level of sports and break boundaries. And we all want to have a lot of fun,” says Sky.\n\n### “We all want to do our best.

And when we finish skating, we don’t chill. We just play something else.”\n\nWhether it’s dancing or skating or surfing, Sky knows no limits, and she’s taking her generation to the top with her. “I love to prove people wrong and show that age or size just does not matter for skateboarders,” she says. “I want to show the world that if you believe in yourself and just go for it, you can do anything.”\n\n### “We have a lot of energy to skate for hours and hours.

And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

            "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## Filmography\n|Year|Title|Role|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|2018|*Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*|Herself|Contestant; winner|\n|2019|*Mani*|Jade|Main role (season 4)|\n|2020|*The Drew Barrymore Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Tom Green, Tabitha Brown\"|\n|2020|*Polly Pocket*|Herself (voice)|2 episodes|\n|2021|*Attaway General*|Jade|Episode: \"Difference Of Opinion\"|\n|2022|*The Tiny Chef Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Snap Pea Stir Fry\"|\n|2022|*Hell's Kitchen: Battle of the Ages*|Herself|Episode: \"Clawing Their Way to the Top\"|\n|2025|*Sneaks*|Sky (voice)| |\n\n## See also\n- Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n## References",

My mind when I skate is just about having fun and showing my best.\n\n\"I like to skate beautifully and hopefully I can do that and show my dance routine.\"... ### Ad content | Stream Sky Sports on NOW\n\n**Stream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

Sky head coach, Tyler Marsh, told the press that he and his team did not report or witness any misconduct while at Gainbridge Fieldhouse and only learned about the allegations after the game had concluded. Nine days later, the WNBA announced their investigation was complete, and all allegations of racist fan behavior were unsubstantiated.\n\nOn June 8, 2025, it was announced that newly signed guard, Courtney Vandersloot, sustained a right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear during the June 7 game against the Indiana Fever and would miss the rest of the season.\n\n## Draft\n|Round|Pick|Player|Position|Nationality|College/Club|Outcome|Ref.|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|1|10|Ajša Sivka|F|Slovenia|Tarbes Gespe Bigorre|Rights retained| |\n|1|11|Hailey Van Lith|G|United States|TCU|Signed rookie contract April 23Made opening day roster| |\n|2|16|Maddy Westbeld|F|United States|Notre Dame|Signed rookie contract April 22Made opening day roster| |\n|2|22|Aicha Coulibaly|G|Mali|Texas A&M|Rights retained| |... ## Transactions\n\n### Front office and coaching\n|Date|Details|Ref.|\n|--|--|--|\n|September 27, 2024|Fired head coach, Teresa Weatherspoon| |\n|November 3, 2024|Hired Tyler Marsh as head coach| |\n|December 18, 2024|Hired Courtney Paris as an assistant coach| |\n|January 4, 2025|Hired Tanisha Wright as an assistant coach| |\n|March 24, 2025|Hired Rena Wakama as an assistant coach| |\n|March 27, 2025|Hired Donnie Marsh as a basketball operations specialist| |\n|March 27, 2025|Promoted David Simon to director of player development| |\n|April 21, 2025|Hired Aaron Johnson as a player development coach| |\n\n### Trades\n|February|February|February|February|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|February 4|To **Chicago Sky****Rebecca Allen**|To **Connecticut Sun**Lindsay AllenRights to Nikolina Milić| |\n|February 7|To **Chicago Sky****2025 No. 16 draft pick2025 No. 22 draft pick**|To **Las Vegas Aces**Dana Evans (sign-and-trade)| |\n|February 23|To **Chicago Sky****Ariel Atkins**|To **Washington Mystics**2025 No. 3 draft pick2027 second round draft pickRights to swap 2027 first round draft picks| |\n|April|April|April|April|\n|April 13|To **Chicago Sky****2025 No. 11 draft pick**|To **Minnesota Lynx**Outright 2026 first-round draft pickExtinguished previous right to exchange 2026 first round draft picks with Chicago| |... ### Subtractions / unsigned\n|Player|Date|Reason|New Team|Ref.|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|María Conde|December 6, 2024|Expansion draft|Golden State Valkyries| |\n|Diamond DeShields|February 3, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|Connecticut Sun| |\n|Brianna Turner|February 16, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|Indiana Fever| |\n|Isabelle Harrison|February 21, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|New York Liberty| |\n|Aicha Coulibaly|April 14, 2025|Unsigned draft pick(2025 draft pick – No. 22)|N/A – retained rights| |\n|Ajša Sivka|April 14, 2025|Unsigned draft pick(2025 draft pick – No. 10)|N/A – retained rights| |\n|Chennedy Carter|April 25, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|Adelitas de Chihuahua| |\n|Tilly Boler|May 3, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Arella Guirantes|May 3, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Sammie Puisis|May 3, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Morgan Bertsch|May 11, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Jessika Carter|May 11, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Alex Wilson|May 11, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Kamilla Cardoso|June 25, 2025|Suspended contract – temporary|N/A – retained rights| |\n|Moriah Jefferson|July 28, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Marquesha Davis|July 28, 2025|Released|—| |... </td><td>9–28 </td></tr><tr><td>38 </td><td>August 28 </td><td>@ Phoenix </td><td>L 79–83 </td><td>Kia Nurse (17) </td><td>Angel Reese (20) </td><td>Cardoso, Nurse, Reese (4) </td><td>PHX Arena10,445 </td><td>9–29 </td></tr><tr><td>39 </td><td>August 30 </td><td>@ Seattle </td><td>L 69–79 </td><td>Angel Reese (20) </td><td>Cardoso, Reese (10) </td><td>Ariel Atkins (8) </td><td>Climate Pledge Arena12,500 </td><td>9–30 </td></tr></table>|\n|September : 1–4 (Home: 1–1;

            "snippet": "# From streets to stadiums: Sky Brown, the youngest Olympic Medallist\n\nEmmy Schouten\n\nSky Brown (16) is one of the most talented skateboarders at this years Olympics. After her bronze medal in Tokyo, Sky is hungry for more. We’ll show you her journey to the Paris Olympics!\n\nMulti-talented\n\nSky Brown is half-British half-Japanese! Born in Miyazaki, her original name is Sukai Buraun (スカイ). Her dad Stuart is British, making here eligible to represent the UK on the Olympics. But he moved to the US before she was born. Sky spends half the year in Japan and the other half in the United States for school. She knows how to keep herself busy. If she’s not skateboarding, you can find her surfing, following guitar lessons or doing some jiu jitsu. Especially surfing is one of her big talents. Her original plan was to compete in\n\n*both* skateboarding and surfing at the Paris Olympics. She failed to qualify at the World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico. Despite not hitting her goal, everybody is super proud. And she’ll definitely try again for the 2028 Olympics ;). Her skateboarding career is the most successful yet. Sky started out with some YouTube tutorials and never had a coach. You can find her practicing in Huntington Beach LA. Sometimes she is joined by 3-time gold snowboarding medallist Shaun White who lives just around the corner.... Fun fact: Did you know that know that Sky won\n\n*Dancing with The Stars; Juniors* in 2018? Prizes\n\nAt just 9-years old, Sky participated in the Vans US Open. The youngest ever to do so! One year later, she became a professional skateboarder, again the youngest ever to do so ;). After her professional debut the prizes started coming. Sky won bronze and gold on the World Championships, two gold medals on the X Games, and silver and gold on the Dew Tour. But her best achievement was at the Tokyo Olympics. It was the year skateboarding debuted on the Olympics. Sky immediately took home bronze. At 13 years old, this made her the youngest UK Olympic medallist ever.\n\nA big inspiration\n\nHer skateboarding achievements inspire girls all over the globe. She became an instant role model. With partnerships from Nike, shoe and skate collaborations, Sky created her own brand. People come up to her wearing her helmet or using her skateboard. It pushes her to be the best version of herself everyday. Her message is clear: don’t care what people think. Everybody just has one life and you can’t let anybody stop you from what you want to do. It is her dream to inspire girls. Not even just in skateboarding, but whatever they want to do. This “Sky Brown-effect” is huge in the UK. In the last 5 years, skateboarding in London grew with 800%! A major part of this is girls hitting the streets after Sky’s Olympic performance.... No pressure\n\nEven with all eyes on her, Sky feels no pressure. Skateboarding is all about fun for her. She never sees it as practicing, it is her happy-place. Skating is her “playground”, and this year La Concorde in Paris will be hers. See her in action on August 6!",

            "snippet": "When 13-year-old professional skateboarding and surfing sensation Sky Brown was voted the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in late 2021 – after being Great Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist at the Tokyo Games wining skateboarding park Bronze – she shared an exciting Gold Medal ambition for Paris 2024 that could be transformative for British surfing and skateboarding: “I want to get two Gold Medals in Paris, for Great Britain, in skateboarding and surfing.” Sky is not a person to make empty promises. Taking gold at The World Skate Championships Olympic qualifying event in Sharjah, UA, she is fully aware of her potential.... ## Joining Team GB\n\nBorn in Miyazaki Japan and raised between the USA and Japan, with a British father and Japanese mother, Sky is a young woman of the world. So, it’s a blessing for British actions sports that she has chosen to represent Team GB in her beloved board riding disciplines. With the opportunity to compete for a number of nations, Sky explained how it was “the more relaxed approach of the British Skateboarding Association” that appealed to her free-spirited style. “I begged my parents to let me go with Team GB,” she said. Her dad Stuart added, “We chose Great Britain because we felt that there was no pressure and they didn’t ask us to commit. They made it very clear that if she wasn’t happy or wasn’t feeling good at any time we could pull out.”... ## It runs in the family... Action sports culture runs deep through the Brown family. Sky’s dad Stuart is a long-time surfer and skater. “He built a backyard mini ramp in our place in California,” said Sky, “and skated everyday with his friends, and I would steal his board, which became my favourite toy when I was small.” Sky’s learning curve was remarkable. At age eight she was in the Vans US Open, the youngest skater ever to compete at the event. At 10 she signed a professional contract with Nike, again breaking records as their youngest athlete. And Sky’s skate style oozes with maturity – smooth, flowing, powerful, all with expert timing born in the arcs and angles of surfing. The family normally surf dawn patrols on the Californian coast around Orange County. “Surfing helps with my skating,” says Sky.... “It’s pretty similar, so if the waves are good, I will surf for three to four hours.” She combines home-schooling with two days each week in class, and skates every afternoon - usually at Prince Park in Oceanside or Poods in Encinitas.... ## Dancing with the stars\n\nSky’s fame skyrocketed after winning ‘Dancing with the Stars Juniors’ in 2018 (the US version of ‘Strictly Come Dancing’) - with US teen dancer JT Church. “We didn’t really know what the show was about,” said Stuart (after the show approached the family, having seen Sky’s growing presence in the skateboarding world). “My wife and Sky started watching it on an iPad. I went to bed and when I woke up at 3am they were still watching it! Sky turned to me and said, ‘Daddy, can I do this show?’ She ended up turning down The X Games – something she’d always wanted to do – to do Dancing with the Stars.”... “It was one of the most fun things I’ve ever done because I’m a girly girl and I got to dance and get my hair and makeup done,” said Sky. Dancing on stage transferred to the concrete with rhythm and tempo becoming key features of Sky’s skate park routines.... ## You've got to get back up\n\nDespite her age, she was heading into Tokyo as a medal contender, already the first female to land a frontside 540. Then, while skating on a mega ramp she fell 15 feet and suffered skull fractures (her helmet saving her life) and a broken wrist and hand. Four days later, knowing she would make a full recovery, she wanted to share the experience on social media:... “People might think I'm super girl or something, but I want to show sometimes you're going to fall. I want to spread the message that it's OK to fall sometimes, you are going to fall, all your heroes are going to fall. I wanted to show you've got to get back up and keep on going. Falling is part of life and that can't stop what you're doing. It was heavy for my parents, it was heavy for my family, but it made me stronger.”... ## Skateboarding for everyone\n\n“I think we showed everyone how beautiful skateboarding is. It’s more of a family vibe, and we’re always pushing each other to do more, to go further. I really hope I inspire some girls. Anyone can do skateboarding. You don’t have to be of a certain height or a certain age – you can do it whenever you want. You’ve just got to skate and go for it. I want to make Britain proud as much as I can, and I hope I did. And I want to inspire the world, especially little girls, and teach them that skateboarding is for everyone. I mean, if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.”... ## It's more than just competition\n\nDespite the obvious shared stoke among competitors at the Olympic skate park, what appears to fuel the competitive fire in Sky is the sibling rivalry she has with her younger brother Ocean, also a red hot skater and surfer. “We compete in everything,” affirms Sky. They share a YouTube channel with a huge and growing fanbase. \"I want to push boundaries, keep on improving, and try to close the gender gap as much as I can,” says Sky, who fears losing to her brother above all else. “I have so many dreams, but one now is to go to underprivileged places and teach kids to skate, because I feel like skateboarding – and other sports – helps people who are struggling.”... ## The Olympics\n\nAnd it’s the Olympic torch that remains so important for Sky’s ever-hotter flame. With a cycle of Paris, Los Angeles and Brisbane coming up, Olympic performance could define her career in the way it did for snowboarder and three times Gold Medallist Shaun White. Sky repeats, “My next big dream is to go to the Olympics in Paris 2024 in skateboarding and surfing and hopefully to win two medals for Britain. That would be really cool.”",

            "snippet": "# Scientific Consensus\n\nIt’s important to remember that scientists always focus on the evidence, not on opinions. Scientific evidence continues to show that human activities (primarily the human burning of fossil fuels) have warmed Earth’s surface and its ocean basins, which in turn have continued to impact Earth’s climate. This is based on over a century of scientific evidence forming the structural backbone of today's civilization.\n\nNASA Global Climate Change presents the state of scientific knowledge about climate change while highlighting the role NASA plays in better understanding our home planet. This effort includes citing multiple peer-reviewed studies from research groups across the world,\n\n1 illustrating the accuracy and consensus of research results (in this case, the scientific consensus on climate change) consistent with NASA’s scientific research portfolio.\n\nWith that said, multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals\n\n1 show that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources.... ## American Scientific Societies\n\n### Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations\n\n\"Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.\" (2009)\n\n2\n\n### American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\n\"Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening.\" (2014)\n\n3\n\n### American Chemical Society\n\n\"The Earth’s climate is changing in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and particulate matter in the atmosphere, largely as the result of human activities.\" (2016-2019)\n\n4\n\n### American Geophysical Union\n\n\"Based on extensive scientific evidence, it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. There is no alterative explanation supported by convincing evidence.\" (2019)\n\n5\n\n### American Medical Association\n\n\"Our AMA ... supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.\" (2019)\n\n6\n\n### American Meteorological Society\n\n\"Research has found a human influence on the climate of the past several decades ... The IPCC (2013), USGCRP (2017), and USGCRP (2018) indicate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-twentieth century.\" (2019)\n\n7... ### American Physical Society\n\n\"Earth's changing climate is a critical issue and poses the risk of significant environmental, social and economic disruptions around the globe. While natural sources of climate variability are significant, multiple lines of evidence indicate that human influences have had an increasingly dominant effect on global climate warming observed since the mid-twentieth century.\" (2015)\n\n8\n\n### The Geological Society of America\n\n\"The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2011), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program (Melillo et al., 2014) that global climate has warmed in response to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases ... Human activities (mainly greenhouse-gas emissions) are the dominant cause of the rapid warming since the middle 1900s (IPCC, 2013).\" (2015)\n\n9\n\n## Science Academies\n\n### International Academies: Joint Statement\n\n\"Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001).\" (2005, 11 international science academies)\n\n1 0... ## U.S. Government Agencies\n\n### U.S. Global Change Research Program\n\n\"Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.\" (2018, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies)\n\n12\n\n## Intergovernmental Bodies\n\n### Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\n“It is unequivocal that the increase of CO\n\n2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.\n\n“Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activity on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact.”\n\n1 3-17... ## Other Resources\n\n### List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations\n\nThe following page lists the nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action.\n\nhttp://www.opr.ca.gov/facts/list-of-scientific-organizations.html\n\n### U.S. Agencies\n\nThe following page contains information on what federal agencies are doing to adapt to climate change.\n\nhttps://www.c2es.org/site/assets/uploads/2012/02/climate-change-adaptation-what-federal-agencies-are-doing.pdf\n\n*Technically, a “consensus” is a general agreement of opinion, but the scientific method steers us away from this to an objective framework. In science, facts or observations are explained by a hypothesis (a statement of a possible explanation for some natural phenomenon), which can then be tested and retested until it is refuted (or disproved).*\n\n*As scientists gather more observations, they will build off one explanation and add details to complete the picture. Eventually, a group of hypotheses might be integrated and generalized into a scientific theory, a scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.*... ### References\n\n**1.** K.

            "snippet": "Mercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, Titan transits Saturn twice, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter this month. Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... Pacific Coast observers will see the pair of shadows at the onset of morning twilight Oct. 25, the last in this series for the month.\nVenus rises at 5 a.m. local daylight time on Oct. 1, shining at magnitude –3.9 among the stars of Leo. It crosses into Virgo by the 9th and its elongation from the Sun is declining, so it rises later each morning. It's joined by the waning crescent Moon on the 19th; the pair rises around 5:30 a.m. across North America. They stand less than 4° apart, with the Moon just two days from New. Through a telescope, Venus displays a 94-percent-lit disk spanning 11″.\nBy the end of October, the phase expands to 96 percent and the disk shrinks to 10″. On the 31st Venus stands 4° north of Spica, although the magnitude 1.0 star is difficult to see in the brightening sky.\nNote: Moon phases in the calendar vary in size due to the distance from Earth and are shown at 0h Universal Time.

In the south lie the elongated Schiller and the detail-packed Gassendi; the equator sports the small and sharp Kepler, leading north to the outstanding half-ring of the Jura Mountains. Keep going north for some lunar history.... The Orionids' radiant is highest early in the morning. Uranus may be visible to sharp-eyed observers without optical aid. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nComet Search: Watch it move!\nFalling steeply into the Sun's gravity well, Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) drops in from the Oort Cloud for a brief two-month visit. By month's end it peaks around 8th magnitude, comparable to Messier galaxies, in the northwest and is accessible to 3-inch scopes from a country location.\nDiscovered in January by D.C. Fuls with the Mount Lemmon Survey in Arizona, this mile-sized ball of dirt and ice is headed to a point half the Sun-Earth distance before shooting back out.\nSkip October's first two weeks, then get ready to jump. As darkness descends, Comet Lemmon is not much more than 20° high and sinks quickly into the horizon haze. Visual observers should note its position in a star field, then again 30 minutes later to see that it's shifted 1/6 the Moon's apparent diameter. Imagers will be happy with the green glow from carbon emission, but the 11″ displacement for a classic one-minute 'sub' will catch many off guard.

This causes heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, increasing the planet’s surface temperature.\n\nThe panel, which is made up of scientists from around the world, including researchers from B.C., has warned for decades that wildfires and severe weather, such as the province’s deadly heat dome and catastrophic flooding in 2021, would become more frequent and intense because of the climate emergency. It has issued a code red for humanity and warns the window to limit warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial times is closing.\n\nAccording to NASA climate scientists, human activities have raised the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide content by 50 per cent in less than 200 years, and “there is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate.”\n\nAs of Sept. 5, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 425.48 parts per million, down slightly from 427.87 ppm last month, according to NOAA data measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory, a global atmosphere monitoring lab in Hawaii. The NOAA notes there has been a steady rise in CO2 from under 320 ppm in 1960.... ### Climate change quick facts:\n\n• The Earth is now about 1.3 C warmer than it was in the 1800s.\n\n• 2024 was hottest year on record globally, beating the record in 2023.\n\n• The global average temperature in 2023 reached 1.48 C higher than the pre-industrial average, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. In 2024, it breached the 1.5 C threshold at 1.55 C.\n\n• The past 10 years (2015-2024) are the 10 warmest on record.\n\n• Human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by nearly 49 per cent above pre-industrial levels starting in 1850.\n\n• The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change including sea level rise, and more intense drought, heat waves and wildfires.\n\n• On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, the temperature could increase by as much 3.6 C this century, according to the IPCC.\n\n• In June 2025, global concentrations of carbon dioxide exceeded 430 parts per million, a record high.\n\n• Emissions must drop 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C and 2.7 per cent per year to stay below 2 C.\n\n• There is global scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that humans are the cause.\n\n• Scientific information taken from natural sources (such as ice cores, rocks, and tree rings) and from modern equipment (like satellites and instruments) all show the signs of a changing climate.\n\n(Sources for quick facts: United Nations IPCC, World Meteorological Organization, UNEP, NASA, climatedata.ca)... ### UN agency says CO2 levels hit record high last year, causing more extreme weather\n\nHeat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a level not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, the United Nations weather agency said Wednesday.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said in its latest bulletin on greenhouse gases, an annual study released ahead of the U.N.’s annual climate conference, that CO2 growth rates have now tripled since the 1960s, and reached levels that existed more than 800,000 years ago.\n\nEmissions from burning coal, oil and gas, alongside more wildfires, have helped fan a “vicious climate cycle,” as people and industries continue to spew heat-trapping gases while the planet’s oceans and forests lose their ability to absorb them, the WMO report said.\n\nThe Geneva-based agency said the increase in the global average concentration of carbon dioxide from 2023 to 2024 amounted to the highest annual level of any one-year span since measurements began in 1957. Growth rates of CO2 have accelerated from an annual average increase of 2.4 parts per million per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020, to 3.5 ppm from 2023 to 2024, it said.\n\n“The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbocharging our climate and leading to more extreme weather,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett in a statement. “Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being.”\n\n*—The Associated Press*... ### ‘I’m the same me’: Canada’s Mark Carney defends his climate record\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he’s focused on climate policies that are likely to have the greatest impact at a time of strained resources and multiple crises, denying criticisms that he’s back pedalling on actions to protect the environment.\n\n“What we need to do is to be as effective as possible, in terms of addressing climate change while growing our economy,” he said during a podcast interview for Bloomberg Weekend’s The Mishal Husain Show.\n\nDespite deep green credentials — including a five-year stint as United Nations special envoy for climate change — Carney has scrapped a number of environmental policies introduced by his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and struck a notably friendlier tone on fossil fuel production. He’s fast-tracked approval for a liquefied natural gas export facility expansion in B.C., opened the door to the possibility of a new oil pipeline to the country’s West Coast, and hasn’t ruled out abandoning plans for an emissions cap for oil and gas producers.\n\nPressed on his plans for the cap, Carney repeatedly responded that “a desired outcome” — in this case emissions reduction — “is not a policy.”\n\n“What makes those emissions go down will be carbon capture and storage,” he said. The former central banker has previously said carbon capture could be part of a “grand bargain” with the province of Alberta that would allow it to increase its fossil fuel exports via a new oil pipeline.\n\n*—Bloomberg News*... ### Southern resident killer whales show signs of slow decline toward disappearance\n\nThe latest survey of endangered southern resident killer whales confirms their plateau and gradual slide toward disappearance in the absence of stronger measures to protect them, a director with the U.S.-based Center for Whale Research says.\n\nMichael Weiss says declining chinook populations, pollutants and noise from ships in the orcas’ habitat off the coast of Washington State and southern B.C. are among the factors driving the decline.\n\n“We’re not talking about southern residents going extinct in the next five years, but we are talking about a fairly good chance of at least one of the (three) pods being gone within the next 50 years,” Weiss said.\n\nThe long-term work of restoring chinook habitat, particularly freshwater spawning grounds, along with adjusting fisheries, would be key to the orcas’ recovery, says Weiss.\n\nHis remarks come with the release on Monday of an annual survey by the organization based in Washington State, offering a snapshot of the population of southern residents as of July 1. This year’s survey found the overall population was 74, up by one from last year.\n\nDuring the census period, researchers documented four births among all three distinct pods of southern residents, but only two calves survived, it says.\n\n*—The Canadian Press*... ### The world is heading to add 57 super hot days a year, but study indicates it could have been worse\n\nThe world is on track to add nearly two months of dangerous super hot days each year by the end of the century, with poorer small nations hit far more often than the biggest carbon-polluting countries, a study released Thursday found.\n\nBut efforts to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that started 10 years ago with the Paris climate agreement have had a significant effect. Without them Earth would be heading to an additional 114 days a year of those deadly extra hot days, the same study found.\n\nThe international collection of climate scientists World Weather Attribution and the U.S.-based Climate Central teamed up to use computer simulations to calculate just how much of a difference the landmark accord has made in terms of one of the biggest climate effects on people: heat waves.\n\nThe report — which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution — calculated how many super hot days the world and more than 200 countries got in 2015, how many Earth gets now and what’s projected in two future scenarios.\n\nOne scenario is if countries fulfil their promises to curb emissions and by the year 2100 the world warms 2.6 C above preindustrial times. That adds 57 super hot days to what Earth gets now, according to the study. The other scenario is the 4 C of warming that the world had been on track to hit before the Paris agreement. The study found that would double the number of additional hot days.\n\n*—The Associated Press*",

            "snippet": "**PROVIDENCE, R.I.** [Brown University] — People who dispute scientific consensus on topics such as vaccine efficacy, climate change or the Big Bang tend to overestimate their own knowledge of these subjects, a new study has shown.\n\nThe study, led by scholars at Brown University, Portland State University and the University of Colorado Boulder, surveyed thousands of Americans online, quizzing them on scientific facts and soliciting their opinions on eight contested topics, including the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe scholars found that respondents who answered more factual questions correctly were more likely to agree with the scientific consensus about each topic. On the other hand, those who answered many factual questions incorrectly but thought they understood certain topics well were more likely to disagree with the scientific consensus. For example, many who said in July 2020 that they would “definitely not get the vaccine” incorrectly answered questions about how viruses spread and how vaccines work, but then said they thought they had a “thorough understanding” of how a COVID-19 vaccine would work.\n\nThe research was published in Science Advances.\n\nSteven Sloman, a co-author of the study and a professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown, said the findings demonstrate that whether or not people agree with scientists doesn’t just depend on how well they understand the science — it also depends on how well they perceive their own understanding. The research also shows the extent to which alternative facts have taken hold in many communities.... “It is a sad fact that our society has returned to an era in which many people’s sense of what’s true is governed more by the beliefs of the people around them than by the hard work of scientists using evidence to test their hypotheses,” Sloman said.\n\nNick Light, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of marketing at Portland State University, said the study reveals why fact-based educational interventions have had only limited success in convincing people to, say, get vaccinated or reduce their individual carbon footprints.\n\n“For many years, smart people thought that the way to bring people more in line with scientific consensus was to teach them the knowledge they lacked,” Light said. “Unfortunately, our research suggests that there may be a problem of overconfidence getting in the way of learning… If people think they know a lot, they have minimal motivation to learn more.”",

As a result, \nshutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is likely within the next 20-30 \nyears, unless actions are taken to reduce global warming – in contradiction to conclusions of IPCC. If \nAMOC is allowed to shut down, it will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several meters – \nthus, we describe AMOC shutdown as the “point of no return.”\nWe suggest that an alternative perspective – a complement to the IPCC approach – is needed to assess \nthese issues and actions that are needed to avoid handing young people a dire situation that is out of their \ncontrol. This alternative approach will make more use of ongoing observations to drive modeling and \nmore use of paleoclimate to test modeling and test our understanding.

Te large \n1991 Pinatubo eruption allows the aerosol forcing to be defned and provide a test of climate impact. Prediction11 \nof global cooling by Pinatubo aerosols was made soon afer the eruption based on initial estimates of aerosol \namount, with peak aerosol forcing −4.5 W/m2 and predicted global cooling 0.5 °C. Later multispectral aerosol \nopacity data of the SAGE satellite instrument12 allowed precise evaluation of opacity of the Pinatubo aerosol layer \nand the dispersion of aerosol sizes,13 which revealed peak forcing as actually −3 W/m2. Multiple runs of a GCM \n(global climate model) with this aerosol forcing produced maximum global cooling afer the volcano of 0.3 °C and \na maximum decrease of Earth’s energy balance of 3 W/m2 (Figure 5) consistent with ERBE satellite observations.14...

We reduced Pinatubo forcing accordingly and smoothed the Pinatubo forcing curve14 \nwith a 3-month running-mean to obtain our estimate of the Hunga forcing. Later estimates (NASA and USask)16,17 \nbased on satellite data bracket the estimate based on Pinatubo but have earlier peak opacity, likely due to the higher \nlatitude of the Hunga eruption, which placed the aerosols closer to where they descend from the stratosphere.\nFigure S3.

            "snippet": "# What's in the sky October 2025\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nWelcome to your October guide to the Southern Hemisphere night sky! This month, we’ve got a fantastic mix of planets, deep sky objects, and even a rare comet to chase. Whether you’re a casual stargazer enjoying the view with binoculars, a telescope enthusiast hunting planets and nebulae, or an astrophotographer capturing the wonders above, there’s plenty to see and explore. From bright planets like Saturn and Mercury to stunning deep sky gems like the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Helix Nebula, October promises plenty of celestial highlights to keep your nights busy.\n\n**Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN**\n\nThis month brings a rare visitor from the outer Solar System: Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, which reaches its closest approach on October 19th, just 0.261 AU from Earth. Last seen in the inner Solar System over 20,000 years ago.\n\nImage Credit: Mike Kane\n\nAfter perihelion on September 12, it developed a striking 5° corkscrew-shaped ion tail visible in photographs. That’s about the length of 10 Full Moons! Currently around magnitude 6, it’s visible with binoculars low on the western horizon just after sunset. Look near Mars and Spica in Virgo to help spot it. As it approaches Earth, it may brighten to magnitude 4, possibly making it visible to the naked eye under dark skies.. This closest approach is due to happen on the 19... th of October, so pencil in the days between the 18 th till the 21 st, as that will hopefully be one of the best opportunities this year to observe a comet. The comet will continue moving through Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius before fading in early November.\n\nAnd since comets can surprise us with sudden changes in brightness or appearance, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN. Look out for an updated video and article from us right before the best viewing nights so you’ll know exactly what to expect and how to spot it.\n\n**Mercury**\n\nThis month, we’ve also got the 2\n\nnd best opportunity of the year to observe Mercury, as it reaches its greatest elongation on the 29 th of October. This is when Mercury reaches it’s greatest distance in the sky from the Sun and makes it the best time to observe the planet.\n\nThe greatest elongation of the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is kind of like their version of opposition. It’s not quite the same, as it’s not when the planet is at it’s largest, but it represents the best opportunity to observe the planet, as it signifies when the planet appears to be the farthest distance form the sun in our sky.... If you don’t have an opportunity to observe on exactly the 29\n\nth, don’t worry! While planetary opposition and elongation events are typically given as just one date, the truth is that while this date represents the absolute peak, observing up to a week before or after is often 90% as good! So don’t think you’ve missed out, you haven’t!\n\n**Saturn**\n\nSpeaking of opposition, while Saturn’s opposition has already passed, secretly we actually think now may be a better time to observe. Why? Because while Saturn is ever so slightly smaller than last month, it’s rising earlier in the night, making it easier to observe for those of us keen to maintain a reasonable bedtime!\n\nWhile the best viewing window is still a little late, between 10 and 12pm, you’ll still get great views of the planet anytime after sunset, and Saturn should be fairly easy to spot in the Northeastern area of the sky.\n\n**Neptune**\n\nOnce again Neptune joins us alongside Saturn in the Sky. If you’ve got a scope big enough (we’d typically recommend and aperture of 6 inches or larger), and you can See Saturn in the sky, then you’ll be able to spot Neptune. There’s not much worth looking at in it’s own right, but if you’re already observing Saturn, you may as well turn your scope to the furthest planet in the Solar system.... Like Saturn, Neptune is best observed between 10-12pm, but you’ll be able to see it anytime after sunset.\n\nIf you’re up late, this month also represents a good time to have a look at Uranus. Again if you’ve got the aperture, you’ll see a tiny grey-blue disk. This month it’s really only for the most dedicated planet hunters, as to have a good view of it, you’ll need to be up between 1-3am, as that’s when it’s best positioned for observing in the sky.... ###\n\n**Uranus**\n\n**Deep Sky Objects This Month**\n\n**The Small Magellanic Cloud/SMC (NGC 292)**\n\nThe main attraction this month is one of the gems of the Southern sky, The Small Magellanic cloud. While it doesn’t take up as much of the sky as it’s cousin the Large Magellanic cloud (more on this incredible object come January), there’s nothing Small about this cloud of stars, as it stretches 4 degrees across in the sky (that’s 8 moons across!).\n\nImage Credit: ESO/VISTA VMC\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud, or SMC for short is a satellite galaxy of the Milkyway, meaning the SMC orbits the Milky way much in a similar way to how the Moon orbits the Earth! It’s exclusively visible to us in the southern hemisphere, and is easily one of the gems of the southern sky.\n\nThe SMC is visible to the naked eye from dark sites with little light pollution, and in fact is one of the furthest objects visible with the naked eye, at a distance of 200,000 light years away. Up the magnification and light gathering with a pair of Binoculars and the SMC will stand out even more, and you’ll also be able to make out some of the details of the galaxy itself. Up the Magnification and light gathering even more with a large telescope, and individual features within the SMC become resolvable.... Another great target this month is NGC 7293, the Helix Nebula. Often also known by the much more dramatic name, the Eye of God Nebula, the Helix Nebula is one of the closest Planetary Nebula to Earth, which makes it one of the rare planetary Nebula in the sky large enough to make out considerable detail through a telescope, as well as being large enough to be a great target astrophotography target for small refractors and Smart telescopes.\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nThrough the eyepiece, you’ll see an eye shape staring right back, and you’ll see more details the darker your sky, and if you have a UHC filter like this one to boost contrast: https://bintel.com.au/products/astronomik-uhc-filter.\n\nPlanetary nebulae like the Helix are formed during the final stages of a medium-sized star’s life. When stars similar in size to our Sun exhaust the fuel in their cores, they shed their outer layers into space, creating an expanding shell of glowing gas. The exposed hot core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation that excites the surrounding gas, causing it to shine in the striking colours we see in photographs. Planetary nebulae aren’t uncommon in the galaxy, but the Helix is special because it’s one of the closest and brightest, making its structure and details much easier to observe.... The Helix Nebula is another quintessentially Southern object. While it is technically observable from the Northern Hemisphere, they don’t get to see it quite like we do, as we get to see it rise right overhead in the night sky.\n\nYou’ll find the Helix nebula in the constellation Aquarius, and it’s best observed between 8 to 10pm, when its at its highest in the night sky.\n\nAnd that brings an end to this month’s guide to the night sky. October offers an incredible variety of observing opportunities for Southern Hemisphere stargazers. From the bright planets like Saturn, Mercury, and Neptune, to a rare visitor from the outer Solar System in Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, there’s something for every type of observer, no matter if you’re up late hunting faint outer planets or enjoying a relaxed evening spotting a comet low on the horizon. The deep sky is equally rewarding, with the Small Magellanic Cloud and its internal treasures like NGC 346, as well as the Helix Nebula, giving both visual observers and astrophotographers stunning targets to explore. With clear skies, dark horizons, and a mix of familiar and extraordinary objects, October is shaping up to be a month that truly showcases the richness of our southern night sky.",

NASA his­\ntory is important as a way to help understand the \ntechnological and societal implications of the space \nage. Furthermore, in looking at NASA’s use of out­\nside scientific advice, we seek to understand what \ngood has come from it, whether it has had signifi­\ncant impacts, and if so, in what ways. The answers \nto such questions, of course, address the question \nof when NASA should seek outside advice. We ask \nhow well has the advisory process worked, what \nefforts worked well, what fell flat, and why? Are \nthere common attributes or recurring themes that \nhelp distinguish between effective efforts and run-\nof-the-mill communications? What are the distinc­\ntions between different sources of outside advice \nand are those distinctions relevant and important? \nFinally, given past experiences and trends, can one \ncount on the process working as well in the future, \nor are there obstacles to be anticipated and over­\ncome?

Part 1 briefly examines early forerunner \nactivities at NACA and in the decade leading up \nto NASA’s formation; it then considers NASA’s use \nof outside advice during its first three decades. Part \n2 picks up the story in 1988 and follows it up to \n2016. Part 3 examines a sampling of case studies, \ndiscusses recurring characteristics of notably suc­\ncessful advisory activities, and provides a glimpse \nof what past experience might imply for the future \nof scientific advice at NASA. The last two chap­\nters provide big-picture summaries of themes that \nhave emerged from earlier discussions.

The first — archival research — drew on... vii\nPreface\nformal process apart from the broader questions of \ngathering scientific advice. Nevertheless, many of \nthe attributes that make other advice effective will \napply to peer reviews as well.\nAlso for the sake of keeping the discussion \nfocused, the book looks mainly at scientific advi­\nsory committees established by NASA (deemed \ninternal committees) and bodies established by \nthe National Research Council (deemed external \ncommittees), especially the Space Science Board, \nits successor the Space Studies Board (SSB), and \ntheir cousins, the Space Applications Board and \nthe Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board. \nSeveral other NRC boards — notably the Board \non Physics and Astronomy, the Board on Atmo­\nspheric Sciences and Climate, the Board on Earth \nSciences and Resources, and the Board on Life Sci­\nences — have organized important advisory studies \nfor NASA. While the monograph’s discussions do \nnot ignore those bodies, the work of the SSB has \nbeen sufficiently extensive that the lessons from \nthe SSB-NASA experience should be more broadly \napplicable to the rest of the NRC in terms of advice \non NASA space and Earth science. \nFinally, there have been other entities besides \nNASA’s formally established internal committees \nand separate groups operating under the aegis of \nthe National Research Council that have provided \nadvice from time to time about the Agency’s sci­\nence programs. Examples include the National \nAcademy of Public Administration, scientific \nsocieties such as the American Astronomical Soci­\nety and the American Geophysical Union, public \ninterest groups such as The Planetary Society, and \na few “blue-ribbon” committees commissioned by \nthe government. The advisory roles of these bodies \nand their cousins have been rather more ad hoc \nand much less ubiquitous than the NASA and \nNRC committees. Given that lessons from the \nlarge body of experience with the latter are quite \nlikely to be relevant to the former, the monograph \nwill not dig into the history of scientific advice \nfrom groups other than those formed by NASA \nand the NRC.... nautics for four decades starting in the 1920s, and \nhe later collaborated with Wernher Von Braun in \ndeveloping the German V-2 rocket.

            "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude. Located inside the border are the cardinal directions and their intermediate points. To find stars, hold the map overhead and orient it so one of the labels matches the direction you’re facing. The stars above the map’s horizon now match what’s in the sky.\n\nThe all-sky map shows how the sky looks at:\n\n10 p.m. October 1\n\n9 p.m. October 15\n\n8 p.m. October 31\n\nPlanets are shown at midmonthOctober2025-SouthernHemisphereDownload",

'm not done yet by the way i'm not done i do hope that you'll continue to watch this into the webinar it's a long video i recommend you take chunks of it at a time it's a lot it's kind of mind-bending information uh it's\ninformation people are not aware of they have not heard of they're completely like \"Wait what are you saying that's not what I was taught that's not what I've learned.\" Um it's like \"Yeah I know welcome to my world.\" So I want to start with this um there's a few truth bombs there's a few uh uh narratives I'... confronted a chemtrail pilot a cloud seating yes absolutely um cloud seating is generally happens with a Cessna airplane and they're using flares to essentially put out silver iodide and many times there's also a type of chaff that is included in this and this is so that they can through satellite actually trace where the the silver iodide is going to see if they actually hit their mark this is highly highly t targeted and highly highly {ts:794680} localized it is not the crisscrosses in in the sky whatsoever so there's a massive confusion around that and that is doing a disservice because it's making people believe that this individual confronted a chemtrail pilot therefore those streaks in the skies are chemtrails and we're being misdirected is what I can say is we're being misdirected from once again two years of research evidence legal team legal researchers meteorologists citizen uh researchers and through their research and efforts they have proven to me the current beliefs around geoengineering and its narrative are completely incorrect and I know I might sound a little mysterious to some of you that's why you've got to watch uh the our webinar from last night so there's that so that has to be clarified um nobody has ever confronted uh a chemtrail pilot um after you know watching flight radar and jumping in their car that has yet to to happen it... 's cloud seating cloud seating is with Cessna's thousand feet up so that need to be clarified big time now there's something else that I have to speak to and this is really really huge um essentially there has been a story continuously circulating that is once again incorrect and that has to do with uh gag orders there has been a story put out there and continues to be put out there that weather reporters meteorologists have been officially told by the government to shut up around identifying any kind of um weather modification weather manipulation programs going on and this\nhas been circulating as the answer to when people ask why don't we know about geoengineering why don't we know about these programs well it's because there's a gag order i thought this was true so two years ago our legal team from Houston Texas we were pursuing this as a first amendment violation by the federal government and it was our job to go out there and most importantly to find the original source document of that gag order from the federal government telling meteorologists and weather reporters not to talk about weather modification programs and what we {ts:929920} understood ultimately and found out because we heard from the actual attorneys who could provide that source document and essentially this is what they had to say this actually comes from the legal council of of what is known as the peer organization the public employees for environmental responsibility and what we found out is that there was no source document putting a gag order on weather reporters and meteorologists this gag order was actually about union negotiation and this was a confidentiality agreement during the negotiation uh that that they could not discuss what was going on behind the scenes during their collective bargaining agreement and Richard Hearn who is the general counsel of the peer organization as well as executive director let us know that there 100% unequivocally is no gag order has never been a gag order on any weather reporters or or meteorologists now again you might start calling me a shill or a CIA agent or something very exciting like And I just want to say all you need to... 've been applying that to our research and our legal work but the average person does not know that and when you say to them hey it's this not that they go oh no you're wrong these engines do not create condensation trails that's absolutely 100% false information why is it important for you to know this because it's leading us down the wrong trail and as we were discussing last night I think what's happened whether it was by design or inadvertently we have this big bad boogeyman out there uh as Jim Lee says it's the straw man and we're told to look way out there for the big bad boogeyman and I guarantee you there's clandestine programs so this is by the way what what we're speaking to is not\nmutually exclusive it's not one or the other it can still be both but the point is this is while we're out there looking for the needle in the haststack which are the clandestine programs we actually have commercial aviation which are now up to 43 million flights over our heads that have jet exhaust that we see that is spewing over us whether you see the condensation trails or not day in day out day in day out and that number is rising exponentially now what's important to this as well is that when we had the individual confronting the chemtrail pilot this individual was stating that her rainwater results showed essentially I guess um chemtrails proof chemtrails mind you she was speaking to a a uh cloud seating pilot and those rainwater {ts:1203919} samples do not reflect cloud seating they do not reflect chemtrails in the way that we think they are those rainwater samples reflect commercial aviation exhaust this actually is what is coming from the exhaust of the jet fuel itself and I know this for a fact why because we Save Our Skies paid for eight of those those very specific rainwater samples from this individual we paid for eight of them for Save Our Skies for illegal pursuit and we paid for them and we saw the results and they reflected jet exhaust nothing else jet exhaust so again that that narrative has to be corrected it... 's misrepresentative of what's really going on and the high bypass turbo fan engines is also misrepresentative of what's really going on and I think what's happened here is that we have been led to look for that needle in the haystack thinking that that is going to if we if we stop it it's you know and get it out of there it's going to bring back the blue skies but it's actually the hay stack that's the problem it's right it's right in front\nof us it's it's it's we don't need to look for the needle it's it's the haystack itself and what is the haystack commercial aviation and people have a hard hard time hearing that why because for years now for years now they've been convinced by certain other individuals who have been scaring the Jesus out of us telling us it's these clandestine programs and again I'm not saying these are not clandestine programs going on america has a history of clandestine programs well doumented this is not an eitheror it's not one or the other my job the job of our Saver Skies team and all the consultants and all the researchers who have been assisting us and holding our hand and and opening our eyes it's been our job to get down to what is real why because we want to be effective so ultimately and we'll get into this when all the geoengineering {ts:1336799} legislation started passing in the states it... 're seeing and know what they're not seeing and be able to delineate between myth and fact and our objective is so that you can look up and go okay this is the day we should be seeing streaks in the sky persistent contrails or this is the day we should\nnot be seeing them whatsoever what is that why am I seeing a persistent contrail and guess what bingo Eureka you are actually uncovering a geoengineering clandestine program right so if the conditions are such where you should not be seeing it and you're like wait a second what is that you've just probably found that needle in the hay stack that is what we've been trying to teach people to do so you know what to expect and when something's unusual it'll pop out at you and we've been teaching that and that has been also through the most accurate narrative the most fact-based and scientifically based information that we have at our hands and to then have individuals continuously go out there repeat the false narrative that there's a gag order that's why you don't know about these clandestine programs that's that are happening everywhere uh and and to continue the false narrative that these high bypass turboan engines uh do not create persistent contrails absolutely uh it is actually covering and clouding {ts:1589360} the truth and then to have the belief that you can use flight radar and track down chemtrail pilots and put them in their place is absolutely also in inaccurate and doing an extraordinary disservice to our fight and to winning and I",

Precious people, there is a\n{ts:4} fake message being spread online. Some claiming that the mightest prophet of the Lord has said that the world will\n{ts:10} end on the 2nd of August. Uh let me say this clearly and without hesitation. That is a lie. It is false and it is not\n{ts:19} from the prophet. [Music] [Music]\n{ts:39} Now what the prophet has always preached if you have followed this ministry even briefly if you have followed the\n{ts:46} ministry of repentance and holiness the ministry of the mightiest prophet of the lord you already know that the that what\n{ts:52} prophet waras never given is a spec a specific date. He has never given a specific date for the end of the\n{ts:60} world or the rapture. In fact, he has consistently and publicly preached that no one knows the day, the hour,\n{ts:69} just as the Lord Jesus said uh in the book of Matthew 24:36. Again, I think I should quote that. The\n{ts:76} book of Matthew 24:36 the Bible says uh but about that day or hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the... {ts:175} that the servants of the Lord have gone to. Even here in Australia, the servant of\n{ts:181} God has always proclaimed the message, the same message, the message of prepare the way the Messiah is coming and the\n{ts:190} need to turn away from sin and live a right and live in righteousness because uh the coming of the Lord is\n{ts:196} very very near precious people and uh never has he ever said that the world will end on this particular date. Not\n{ts:204} now. Be always on the guard. Be always watchful.\n{ts:217} Be always prepared. [Music] Be ready all the time\n{ts:225} and looking up all the time because nobody knows the day or the hour.\n{ts:231} [Music] and pray that you may be able to escape what is about to happen to the whole\n{ts:236} earth. That's a deliberate prayer direct. Now the source and motive behind the lie\n{ts:251} probably someone might ask himself what's the source and the motive behind this line? So where did this rumor come\n{ts:256} from? Now now let's let's be honest here. This we definitely know that this is the work of um money lovers,... {ts:265} attention seekers, people hungry for views, um clicks and online traffic. Um they know the name of the prophet draws\n{ts:276} attention. So they attempt to drag it into lies to boost their platforms. They're very sad\n{ts:284} to drag the name of the servant of the lord into their lies just so so that they may just boost the traffic. You\n{ts:292} know they don't even have the the evidence that the servant of the lord spoke said that others create fake\n{ts:298} headlines or posts just to sty controversies. It's about algorithms and you know ad revenue money. But how\n{ts:307} tragic, how tragic and how sad to use the fear of the end times to drive engagement.\n{ts:315} How sad to manipulate sacred matters for personal gain. How sad. The Bible warns in the book of Galatians 6:7 that do not\n{ts:325} be deceived. God is not mocked. Whatever a man sws that will also reap. He will also reap that. And actually the the the\n{ts:336} ministry official pages um for example on Facebook has come out to to really set the record straight that there is... {ts:344} nothing like that that the servant of the Lord had ever said. Now this is not a game. These are people's soul that\n{ts:353} someone is busy playing with. You know to those pushing this lie. My address will be just please repent.\n{ts:361} you know uh and try to use the chance the time that you have to turn back to God because you know every idle word\n{ts:370} will be brought into judgment every idol word will be brought into judgment that day and that day is very very coming. So\n{ts:377} let's set the the the record straight. Let's set the record straight that um here is what the prophet has actually\n{ts:383} stood for and has actually said over and over again. There is a day that is coming\n{ts:393} and that day when it arrives it will change the earth total totally.\n{ts:407} It will be irretrievable, irreversible, irrevable. [Music]\n{ts:421} He's saying that there is a day that is coming\n{ts:430} when the Lord as we are going to see now in the scripture\n{ts:436} when the Lord himself will come down to take the church. We are going to see in the scripture... {ts:443} just now. Now this is a message probably to us those\n{ts:451} who are believers are Christians. How should we respond then? Number one, we don't need to share rumors. We don't\n{ts:459} need to forward lies. Don't be part of spreading and and spreading confusion. You know, if it doesn't match the\n{ts:466} scripture or the voice of the Lord's true servant, reject it. Reject it. We have to stand, you know,\n{ts:475} we have to uh to to to to speak the truth. If someone tells you that the prophet has said that the world is\n{ts:482} ending on a particular day, we have to be firm and respond, you know, gently but firm and debunk this\n{ts:491} this lies, you know. Now, we need to focus on our personal preparation. The issue is not the date. Actually, the\n{ts:498} issue is your soul. Are you ready? That's the should be the question. Are you ready? Uh today, for\n{ts:506} example, if the Lord were to come, are you ready? We know you devil, the devil has been... {ts:513} using the same same tactics to dissuade people and to lie to many people and busy leading them to hell. The enemy\n{ts:520} knows that his time is short, very short. and uh and and and and that's why you know lies you know uh lies like this\n{ts:530} are being spread uh and manufactured people hellbent to create lies lies like this to taint the name of the\n{ts:542} ministry of the Lord you know they're busy mocking God's word you know discrediting every word that is in the\n{ts:550} Bible and try to distract the church That is the goal. They're trying to distract the church. But let me say\n{ts:556} again, God cannot be mocked. The Lord will defend his own word. [Music]\n{ts:574} [Music]",

            "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_or_misleading_statements_by_Donald_Trump",
            "snippet": "The story broke while Donald Trump's presidential campaign was in full swing, and journalist Rob Crilly noted that at that time he \"has had more weighty facts to clarify, such as his claim that Muslims in New Jersey cheered on the day of the 9/11 attacks – an old rumour that has long been discredited – and his latest boast, that he watched people jumping to their deaths from the Twin Towers from his Manhattan flat, four miles [6 km] away\". According to Jack Holmes of *Esquire* magazine, the ahistorical marker is symptomatic of the Trump administration; Jack Holmes points at other historical blunders made by members of the Trump administration, including Kellyanne Conway's reference to the non-existent Bowling Green massacre and Sean Spicer's claim that even Hitler had not used chemical weapons in conventional warfare, although Zyklon-B was used to exterminate prisoners in the Holocaust.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed he is an 18-time club championship winner at several clubs, none of which can be positively confirmed, and 16 of which were not official or all-member club championships. All these wins have been recorded at golf clubs owned or managed by The Trump Organization. Professional and amateur golfers, such as Buddy Marucci, have claimed that Trump would threaten to revoke the membership of anyone who won against him, thus allowing him to win club championships with little competition. Trump has claimed to have won the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach Club Championship in 1999, before the club was officially opened to membership, and the 2023 Senior Club Championship at the same course, despite not being present for the first day.... Trump at Naval Station Norfolk Pier 14, Norfolk, VirginiaOctober 5, 2025\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump falsely claimed to have predicted the attacks in his 2000 book *The America We Deserve* (ghostwritten by Dave Shiflett), that Osama bin Laden was not well known when the book was published, and that it called for the U.S. to \"take him out\". The book does contain two separate passages that mention bin Laden (who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list since June 7, 1999) and suggest an incident worse than the 1993 World Trade Center bombing may occur, but it does not call for the preemptive killing of bin Laden nor suggest he would be the one to orchestrate such an event if not killed. The ghostwriter, Shiflett, has called *The America We Deserve* \"[his] first work of fiction\".\n\nDuring his second presidency on October 5, 2025, Trump reiterated the falsehood at an event in Norfolk, Virginia celebrating the upcoming 250th anniversary of the US Navy's founding (October 13). Bringing up the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden under the Obama administration, Trump subsequently claimed to have warned his incumbent Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of bin Laden's activity before the September 11th attacks in 2000 (or erroneously in 2024). In 2000, 19-year-old Hegseth enrolled at Princeton University, most likely never meeting Trump during his enrollment. Hegseth would not become the United States Secretary of Defense until January 25, 2025 at age 44, over two decades after the attack and less than ten months before Trump made this version of the false claim.... Trump claimed that his father had given him \"a small loan of a million dollars\", which he used to build \"a company that's worth more than $10 billion\", denying Marco Rubio's allegation that he had inherited $200 million. A 2018 *New York Times* exposé on Fred and Donald Trump's finances concludes that Donald \"was a millionaire by age 8\", and that he had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime, including over $60 million ($140 million in 2018 currency) in loans, which were largely unreimbursed.\n\nTrump claimed repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2015 that the actual unemployment rate of around 5% \"isn't reflective [of reality] ... I've seen numbers of 24%, I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment\". PolitiFact rated this claim \"Pants on Fire\", its rating for the most egregious falsehoods. Jeremy Adam Smith, writing for the *Greater Good Magazine*, said Trump's falsehoods may be \"blue lies\", which are \"told on behalf of a group, that can actually strengthen the bonds among the members of that group\". As a result, he posited, Trump's dishonesty does not lose the support of his political base, even while it \"infuriates and confuses almost everyone else\".... By October 9, 2019, *The Washington Post*'s fact-checking team documented that Trump had \"made 13,435 false or misleading claims over 993 days\". On October 18, 2019, the *Washington Post* Fact Checker newsletter described the situation:\n\nA thousand days of Trump. We often hear from readers wondering how President Trump's penchant for falsehoods stacks up in comparison to previous presidents. But there is no comparison: Trump exists in a league of his own. Deception, misdirection, gaslighting, revisionism, absurd boasts, and in some cases, provable lies, are core to his politics.\n\nAfter departing the White House, January 20, 2021, Trump gave a farewell address at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland prior to departing on Air Force One for his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. The AP fact-checked his speech, and reported that it included false statements about his presidency and administration's accomplishments. These included statements that he passed the largest tax cuts in history; that the U.S. economy during his tenure was the greatest in U.S. history; that he achieved record job creation; that his administration rebuilt both the U.S. military and the American manufacturing industry; that he destroyed the ISIS caliphate; and a reiteration of his previously repeated falsehood that he, and not former President Barack Obama, had passed the Veterans Choice Act. These falsehoods added to the 30,573 falsehoods that *The Washington Post*'s fact-checker had tallied by the end of Trump's presidency, an average of 21 falsehoods a day.\n\nScholarly analysis of Trump's tweets found \"significant evidence\" of an intent to deceive:\n\nAnalyzing Trump's tweets with a regression function designed to predict true and false claims based on their language and composition, it finds significant evidence of intent underlying most of Trump's false claims, and makes the case for calling them lies when that outcome agrees with the results of traditional fact-checking procedures.... We argue, based on our findings here, that intent to deceive is a reasonable inference from most of Trump's false tweets, and that drawing that conclusion when the evidence warrants could help scholars and journalists alike better explain the strategic functions of political falsehoods.... ### Commentary and analysis\n\nAs president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks. Trump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office according to *The New York Times*, and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of *The Washington Post*. By the *Post*'s tally, it took Trump 601 days to reach 5,000 false or misleading statements and another 226 days to reach the 10,000 mark. For the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections, it rose to an average of 30 per day from 4.9 during his first 100 days in office. The *Post* found that Trump averaged 15 false statements per day during 2018.\n\nThe *New York Times* editorial board frequently lambasted Trump's dishonesty. In September 2018, the board called him \"a president with no clear relation to the truth\". The following month, the board published an opinion piece titled, \"Donald Trump Is Lyin' Up a Storm\".\n\nJames Comey had frequent discussions with Trump, and in his first major interview after his firing he described Trump as a serial liar who tells \"baffling, unnecessary\" falsehoods:... #### Denial of collusion with Russia\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed he and his campaign did not collude with Russia, and Republicans and many otherwise reliable sources have repeated that false claim even though Mueller said that he did not investigate \"collusion\", only \"conspiracy\" and \"coordination\". The claim that there was no collusion has been described as a myth.\n\nIn a January 2019 interview, Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani undermined Trump's claim when he \"claimed Wednesday night that he 'never said there was no collusion' between President Trump's campaign and Russia leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\nGiuliani: [complained about] 'false reporting' on the Russia investigation.Cuomo: 'Mr. Mayor, false reporting is saying that nobody in the campaign had any contacts with Russia. False reporting is saying that there has been no suggestion of any kind of collusion between the campaign and any Russians.'Giuliani: 'You just misstated my position. I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign.'Cuomo: 'Yes, you have.'\n\nAfter his comments, Giuliani made statements that NPR described as an \"apparent reversal\" from his TV interview: He said \"'there was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form' and that he had 'no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign'.\"\n\nThe investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal \"conspiracy\".",

I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign.'Cuomo: 'Yes, you have.'\n\nAfter his comments, Giuliani made statements that NPR described as an \"apparent reversal\" from his TV interview: He said \"'there was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form' and that he had 'no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign'.\"\n\nThe investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal \"conspiracy\".... #### Hurricane Dorian\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian approached the Atlantic coast in August 2019, Trump presented himself as closely monitoring the situation, tweeting extensively as *The New York Times* reported he was \"assuming the role of meteorologist in chief\". On September 1, Trump tweeted that Alabama, among other states, \"will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\". By that time, no forecaster was predicting Dorian would impact Alabama and the eight National Hurricane Center forecast updates over the preceding 24 hours showed Dorian steering well away from Alabama and moving up the coast. The Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) contradicted Trump 20 minutes later, tweeting that Alabama \"will NOT see any impacts from Dorian.\" After ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl reported the correction, Trump tweeted it was \"Such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl\".\n\nOn September 4, in the Oval Office, Trump displayed a modified version of an August 29 diagram by the National Hurricane Center of the projected track of Dorian. The modification was done with a black marker and extended the cone of uncertainty of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama. Modifying government weather forecasts is illegal in the U.S. Trump was known to use a Sharpie to write on documents, as well as speech notes and on the campaign trail. A White House official told *The Washington Post* Trump had altered the diagram with a Sharpie marker. Trump said he did not know how the map came to be modified and defended his claims, saying he had \"a better map\" with models that \"in all cases [showed] Alabama was hit\". Later on September 4, Trump tweeted a map by the South Florida Water Management District dated August 28 showing numerous projected paths of Dorian; Trump falsely asserted \"almost all models\" showed Dorian approaching Alabama. A note on the map stated it was \"superseded\" by National Hurricane Center publications and that it was to be discarded if there were any discrepancies.... On September 5, after Fox News correspondent John Roberts reported about the story, Trump summoned him to the Oval Office. Roberts later characterized Trump as \"just looking for acknowledgment that he was not wrong for saying that at some point, Alabama was at risk—even if the situation had changed by the time he issued the tweet\". Trump's Homeland Security Advisor Peter Brown issued a statement asserting Trump had been provided a graphic on September 1 showing tropical storm force winds touching the southeastern corner of Alabama; a White House source told CNN that Trump had personally instructed Brown to issue the statement.\n\nOn September 6, at Trump's direction, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to order acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs to fix the contradiction by Birmingham NWS, and Ross threatened to fire top NOAA officials if he did not. NOAA then tweeted a statement by an unnamed spokesman disavowing the Birmingham NWS tweet, asserting \"the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\" adding that the Birmingham tweet \"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time\". The president of the NWS Employees Organization responded, \"the hard-working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight\". Former senior NOAA executives were sharply critical. That evening, Trump tweeted a video of a CNN hurricane forecast from the Wednesday before his Sunday tweet in which the forecaster mentioned Alabama could be affected by Dorian—with the video altered to show \"Alabama\" being repeated several times; the video ended with a CNN logo careening off a road and bursting into flames. Trump continued to insist he was correct through September 7, asserting \"The Fake News Media was fixated\" and tweeting forecast maps from at least two days before his original Sunday tweet, as the media dubbed the episode \"Sharpiegate\". Commentators expressed bafflement that Trump chose to insist he was correct about what might otherwise have passed as a minor gaffe.\n\nOn September 9, NWS director Louis Uccellini said the Birmingham NWS had not tweeted in response to Trump's tweet, but in response to phone calls and social media contacts they had received in response to Trump's tweet. \"Only later, when the retweets and politically based comments started coming to their office, did they learn the sources of this information,\" he said.",

Misinformation can cause widespread societal harm. For example, we have seen how \nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories resulted in resistance to government-recommended safety protocols \n[6,7]\nsuch as mask-wearing and vaccination . In this handbook, we will focus on debunking climate change \nmisinformation through psychological inoculation, so named for its parallels to the process of \nbiological inoculation. Psychological inoculation is a process of exposing people to examples of \nmisinformation techniques, including refutations of the misinformation, so that they build “cognitive \nantibodies,” enabling them to spot and resist misinformation in the future. Psychological inoculation \n[14]\nhas proven effective across a number of topics, including climate change .\nHuman-induced climate change is causing changes to our weather, our ecosystems, our infrastructure, \nand our health, most of which are having adverse consequences.

Climate Myth Debunking for \nBroadcast Meteorologists\n05\nBreaking the Climate Silence\nResearch has shown that many people choose not to talk about climate change—and other issues\n—because they fear judgment or pushback from others. This comes from a phenomenon known as \npluralistic ignorance—the tendency for people to misperceive others' opinions, thinking that they are in a \nminority when in reality, most others hold the same opinions\n[8]. This has been a barrier in the past that \nprevented broadcast meteorologists from discussing climate change on air. However, a majority (62%) \nof broadcast meteorologists who share climate-change-related information with their audiences \nreceive mostly positive responses from their audience\n[21].\nWhile the fear of being disliked or losing respect of the audience after discussing climate change is \ncertainly understandable, broadcast meteorologists can rest assured that 70% of Americans believe \nclimate change is happening, and will appreciate hearing about climate change from broadcasters\n[8, 21, 10, 11].\nHow to Structure a Debunking\nAn effective debunking should aim to incorporate the following elements, following the Fact-Myth-\nFallacy-Fact structure\n[13]:\n\nClimate Myth Debunking for \nBroadcast Meteorologists\n06\nClimate change is \ncaused by the sun\n“\n“\nFact-Myth-Fallacy-Fact Example...

It was correct at the time of writing. Our latest fact checks about Covid-19 and the pandemic can be found here.*\n\nA video on Instagram that has been viewed more than 20,000 times claims that a second wave of Covid-19 has been planned, and Covid-19 vaccines are going to be fatal.\n\nBoth claims are false.\n\nConspiracy theories about the planning of Covid-19 have been shared widely on social media before. These include claims that Full Fact has already debunked, including that Event 201 (a pandemic response planning exercise) was a “rehearsal” for the coronavirus pandemic, that the virus was man-made and that Bill Gates owns the vaccine for or patent of Covid-19.\n\nThere is no evidence that the creation or spread of Covid-19 has at any point been orchestrated by political, commercial or other organisations/institutions.... In any case, a “second-wave” of Covid-19 cases has already happened (at least in the UK) and political leaders have begun warning of a third wave rise in cases.\n\nWe have also repeatedly debunked claims that Covid-19 vaccines are deadly. Analysis by the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) did not suggest that fatalities of early recipients were caused by the vaccine. It also found the none of the serious adverse reactions reported appear to have been caused by the vaccine.\n\nMore recent data on the Yellow Card scheme (the UK system for collecting and monitoring information on safety concerns such as suspected side effects or adverse incidents involving medicines and medical devices) shows that despite many millions of vaccine doses administered no new safety concerns have been reported. The MHRA also notes that of the “medical conditions reported in temporal association with vaccination, the available evidence does not currently suggest that the vaccine caused the event.”\n\n**Update 16 August 2021**\n\nA line was added at the beginning of this article to reflect new information about vaccine safety, which appeared after it was published.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

            "snippet": "Abraham Lincoln did not have social media in his time. If he did, I honestly believe he might have reconsidered his final observation that \"you cannot fool all the people all the time.\" There have been a few stories in recent years that have made their way through cyberspace that have been pretty much off the wall … so much so, you would think that very few, if any, people would be fooled.\n\nBut in reality, a surprisingly large number of people took them at face value, believing they were true.\n\nThe most famous, of course, is the annual \"Mars Hoax,\" which rears its ugly head every August. Ever since a historically close approach of the Red Planet to Earth occurred in August 2003, a spurious Internet story has circulated every year since, which implies that on a specific night in late August, Mars will loom in the sky as the same size as the full moon. Totally untrue, of course, yet every year there are countless people who actually believe it will happen.\n\nThen earlier this year, a widely shared story on the Web claimed that Jan. 4 was \"Zero Gravity Day,\" a date when people on Earth would supposedly be able to experienceweightlessness if they jumped into the air at a specific moment that day. One has to wonder just how many people worldwide actually tried to float on that day.... And now, are you ready for this? Sunday (Nov. 15), the Earth supposedly will be plunged into darkness for 15 days, all thanks to a \"rare phenomenon\" caused by the movement of Venus and Jupiter. [10 Alien Encounter Claims Debunked]\n\nOf course, like the Mars story and Zero Gravity Day, this supposed worldwide blackout is false. And yet, the Internet is crackling with all sorts of reports on what to expect.\n\n**A fake news space meme**\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\nA fake news site — \"Newswatch 33\" — is apparently the reference source for this bogus report. The Earth, the report says, will go dark Nov. 15, just before 3 a.m. (no clue if this is Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific Standard or any other time). Then, after 15 days, the eerie darkness will finally lift on Nov. 30, at 4:45 p.m.\n\nPresident Barack Obama purportedly has been briefed about the upcoming phenomenon in a 1,000-page memorandum from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.\n\nThe reason given for the blackout? The recent close conjunction of Venus and Jupiterin the predawn morning sky of Oct. 26. Venus, always the brightest planet, came so close to Jupiter as seen from here on Earth that its dazzling light heated the Jovian atmosphere.... Of course, the two planets were actually separated in space by 535 million miles (860 million kilometers); the fake news story somehow manages to overlook that important point. [See photos of Venus and Jupiter in the Night Sky]\n\nJupiter's reaction to Venus' \"close approach\" was to supposedly release a huge amount of hydrogen into its atmosphere, which in turn was apparently ejected into space and Sunday will induce a massive explosion on the sun.\n\nWait … it gets better.\n\nThe story continues to claim that the sun will then react to the outburst by attempting to cool itself down and in the process,\n\n*will then turn blue* as a result.\n\nAnd that's when everything on this planet of ours is supposed to go dark.\n\nThe apocryphal details go on to claim that Bolden doesn't think the Earth will experience any major issues during the blackout: \"This event will be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter,\" Bolden supposedly says. \"The only other effect it will have is everyone will get to have a true Black Friday after Thanksgiving.\"\n\nThere's even a hashtag — #NovemberBlackOut — where people can tweet what they are going to do during the days of darkness.\n\n**A cosmic case of nonsense**\n\nAll of this is complete and utter nonsense, of course! The sun will continue shining through Thanksgiving, just as it does every year.... Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" hoax was has been circulated a few times before, most recently this past June.\n\nSnopes, the website that reports on the validity of rumors and urban legends, has also posted its own take on this fallacy: http://www.snopes.com/15-days-darkness-november/\n\nBottom line: Planet Earth will not go dark on Sunday … or at any time in the near (or distant) future. Any email or social media claims to the contrary are completely bogus.\n\nDon’t keep your family and friends \"in the dark\" (pun firmly intended) and spread the word.\n\n*Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York's Hayden Planetarium.

However, our research reveals the claim is misleading. A reverse image search traced the visuals to Lviv, Ukraine, dating back to August 2021. The footage matches earlier reports and was even covered by the Ukrainian news outlet 24 Kanal, which published the story under the headline “Lviv Covered by Unique Thundercloud: Amazing Video”. Thus, the viral claim linking the phenomenon to a recent event in India is false.\n\n### Claim:\n\nA viral video circulating on social media claims to show a massive cloud formation over Gurugram, Haryana, and the Delhi NCR region on 3rd September 2025. The cloud appears to be a cumulonimbus formation, which is typically associated with heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and severe weather conditions.\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nAfter conducting a reverse image search on key frames of the viral video, we found matching visuals from videos that attribute the phenomenon to Lviv, a city in Ukraine. These videos date back to August 2021, thereby debunking the claim that the footage depicts a recent weather event over Gurugram, Haryana, or the Delhi NCR region.\n\nFurther research revealed that a Ukrainian news channel named 24 Kanal, had reported on the Lviv thundercloud phenomenon in August 2021. The report was published under the headline “Lviv Covered by Unique Thundercloud: Amazing Video” ( original in Russian, translated into English).... ###\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe viral video does not depict a recent weather event in Gurugram or Delhi NCR, but rather an old incident from Lviv, Ukraine, recorded in August 2021. Verified sources, including Ukrainian media coverage, confirm this. Hence, the circulating claim is misleading and false.\n\n- Claim: Old Thundercloud Video from Lviv city in Ukraine Ukraine (2021) Falsely Linked to Delhi NCR, Gurugram and Haryana.\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading.\n\n### Executive Summary:\n\nA viral social media claim alleges that India’s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Anil Chauhan, praised Pakistan’s Army as superior during “Operation Sindoor.” Fact-checking confirms the claim is false. The original video, available on The Hindu’s official channel, shows General Chauhan inaugurating Ran-Samwad 2025 in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. At the 1:22:12 mark, the genuine segment appears, proving the viral clip was altered. Additionally, analysis using Hiya AI Audio identified voice manipulation, flagging the segment as a deepfake with an authenticity score of 1/100. The fabricated statement was: “never mess with Pakistan because their army appears to be far more superior.” Thus, the viral video is doctored and misleading.... ###\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, we located the full version of the video on the official YouTube channel of the Press Information Bureau (PIB), published on 11 May 2025. In this video, at the 59:57-minute mark, the Vice Admiral can be heard saying:\n\n“This time if Pakistan dares take any action, and Pakistan knows it, what we are going to do. That’s all.”\n\nFurther analysis was conducted using the Hive Moderation tool to examine the authenticity of the circulating clip. The results indicated that the video had been artificially generated, with clear signs of AI manipulation. This suggests that the content was not genuine but rather created with the intent to mislead viewers and spread misinformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n###\n\nThe viral video attributing remarks to Vice Admiral AN Pramod about India seeking U.S. and President Trump’s intervention against Pakistan is misleading. The extended speech, available on the Press Information Bureau’s official YouTube channel, contained no such statement. Instead of the alleged claim, the Vice Admiral concluded his comments by saying, “That’s all.” AI analysis using Hive Moderation further indicated that the viral clip had been artificially manipulated, with fabricated audio inserted to misrepresent his words. These findings confirm that the video is altered and does not reflect the Vice Admiral’s actual remarks.\n\nClaim: Fake Viral Video Claiming Vice Admiral AN Pramod saying that next time if Pakistan Attack we will complain to US and Prez Trump.\n\nClaimed On: Social Media\n\nFact Check: False and Misleading... ### Executive Summary:\n\n###\n\nA video circulating on social media falsely claims to show Indian Air Chief Marshal AP Singh admitting that India lost six jets and a Heron drone during Operation Sindoor in May 2025. It has been revealed that the footage had been digitally manipulated by inserting an AI generated voice clone of Air Chief Marshal Singh into his recent speech, which was streamed live on August 9, 2025.\n\n**Claim:**\n\nA viral video (archived video) (another link) shared by an X user stating in the caption “ Breaking: Finally Indian Airforce Chief admits India did lose 6 Jets and one Heron UAV during May 7th Air engagements.” which is actually showing the Air Chief Marshal has admitted the aforementioned loss during Operation Sindoor.\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nBy conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, we found a clip which was posted by ANI Official X handle , after watching the full clip we didn't find any mention of the aforementioned alleged claim.\n\nOn further research we found an extended version of the video in the Official YouTube Channel of ANI which was published on 9th August 2025. At the 16th Air Chief Marshal L.M. Katre Memorial Lecture in Marathahalli, Bengaluru, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh did not mention any loss of six jets or a drone in relation to the conflict with Pakistan. The discrepancies observed in the viral clip suggest that portions of the audio may have been digitally manipulated.\n\nThe audio in the viral video, particularly the segment at the 29:05 minute mark alleging the loss of six Indian jets, appeared to be manipulated and displayed noticeable inconsistencies in tone and clarity.... ### Conclusion:\n\nThe viral video claiming that Air Chief Marshal AP Singh admitted to the loss of six jets and a Heron UAV during Operation Sindoor is misleading. A reverse image search traced the footage that no such remarks were made. Further an extended version on ANI’s official YouTube channel confirmed that, during the 16th Air Chief Marshal L.M. Katre Memorial Lecture, no reference was made to the alleged losses. Additionally, the viral video’s audio, particularly around the 29:05 mark, showed signs of manipulation with noticeable inconsistencies in tone and clarity.\n\n- Claim: Viral Video Claiming IAF Chief Acknowledged Loss of Jets Found Manipulated\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n****\n\nA viral video (archive link) claims General Upendra Dwivedi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), admitted to losing six Air Force jets and 250 soldiers during clashes with Pakistan. Verification revealed the footage is from an IIT Madras speech, with no such statement made. AI detection confirmed parts of the audio were artificially generated.\n\n**** **Claim:**\n\n****... The claim in question is that General Upendra Dwivedi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), admitted to losing six Indian Air Force jets and 250 soldiers during recent clashes with Pakistan.\n\n**** **Fact Check:**\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, it was found that the original footage is from IIT Madras, where the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) was delivering a speech. The video is available on the official YouTube channel of ADGPI – Indian Army, published on 9 August 2025, with the description:\n\n*“Watch COAS address the faculty and students on ‘Operation Sindoor – A New Chapter in India’s Fight Against Terrorism,’ highlighting it as a calibrated, intelligence-led operation reflecting a doctrinal shift. On the occasion, he also focused on the major strides made in technology absorption and capability development by the Indian Army, while urging young minds to strive for excellence in their future endeavours.”*\n\nA review of the full speech revealed no reference to the destruction of six jets or the loss of 250 Army personnel. This indicates that the circulating claim is not supported by the original source and may contribute to the spread of misinformation.\n\nFurther using AI Detection tools like Hive Moderation we found that the voice is AI generated in between the lines.... **** **Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is baseless. The video is a manipulated creation that combines genuine footage of General Dwivedi’s IIT Madras address with AI-generated audio to fabricate a false narrative. No credible source corroborates the alleged military losses.\n\n- Claim: AI-Generated Audio Falsely Claims COAS Admitted to Loss of 6 Jets and 250 Soldiers\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nAs we researched a viral social media video we encountered, we did a comprehensive fact check utilizing reverse image search. The video circulated with the claim that it shows illegal Bangladeshi in Assam's Goalpara district carrying homemade spears and attacking a police and/or government official. Our findings are certain that this claim is false. This video was filmed in the Kishoreganj district, Bangladesh, on July 1, 2025, during a political argument involving two rival factions of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The footage has been intentionally misrepresented, putting the report into context regarding Assam to disseminate false information.\n\n**Claim:**\n\nThe viral video shows illegal Bangladeshi immigrants armed with spears marching in Goalpara, Assam, with the intention of attacking police or officials.... Claim: Video shows illegal migrants with spears moving in groups to assault police!\n\nClaimed On: Social Media\n\nFact Check: False and Misleading",

The digitally manipulated video is part of a Pakistani propaganda campaign, and the PIB has urged people to rely on verified sources and report suspicious content.\n\nEver since the Indian Armed Forces targeted terrorist establishments in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under Operation Sindoor to avenge the death of 26 people in the Pahalgam terrorist attack, fake posts about the Indian Army have been circulating on social media. One such post by Pakistani propaganda accounts falsely shows a digitally altered video of Western Command Chief Lt Gen Manoj Kumar Katiyar, claiming that payments were made to the Afghan Taliban to act against Pakistan. The post further alleged that the Taliban accepted the money and are now fighting for India against Pakistan.\n\n**PIB debunks fake video**\n\nThe Press Information Bureau (PIB) has firmly debunked the misinformation, stating, \"Western Command Chief Lt. Gen. Manoj Kumar Katiyar has NOT given any such statement!\" The PIB clarified that these AI-manipulated videos are part of a propaganda campaign aimed at misleading the public and creating panic. The bureau also shared a YouTube link to the genuine, unedited video for public verification, urging people to rely only on authentic sources.... **How to report fake content**\n\nThe PIB added, \"If you spot such content, please report it to us on 8799711259 and mail at factcheck@pib.gov.in. .\" Authorities have also urged public vigilance to prevent the spread of misleading information.\n\n**India-Pakistan conflict**\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces launched a massive operation against terror groups in Pakistan and PoK in retaliation to the Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 innocent people. India launched ardent and precise strikes under Operation Sindoor, destroying over nine terror camps. These locations were key command centres of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), responsible for major attacks like Pulwama (2019) and Mumbai (2008). More than 100 terrorists were killed in the attack.\n\nIn retaliation, Pakistan attempted strikes on Indian military bases over the next three days - May 8, 9, and 10. Reacting to this, India launched missile and drone attacks, targeting key military establishments of Pakistan. After four days of intense cross-border drone and missile exchanges, Pakistan reached out to India and requested for a ceasefire.\n\n**ALSO READ: Fact check: PIB debunks fake video of Trump discussing India-Pakistan conflict, shares original clip**",

While some of the smoke combined with slightly elevated light density urban fine particulate aerosols associated with light morning winds or slightly elevated relative humidity levels over the eastern two-thirds of Texas may raise PM2.5 levels to the \"Moderate\" range at times, the overall daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to net out in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Brownsville-McAllen and Houston areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, Laredo, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.... Light winds, warm temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels could be enough for ozone to reach the upper end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas; the middle of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin and San Antonio areas; the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Bryan-College Station, Midland-Odessa, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas; and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Laredo, and Victoria areas.\n\nDepending on the amount of prescribed burning activities across parts of the Mississippi River Valley and East Texas, light density residual smoke may begin to expand over portions of East and Southeast Texas, slightly raising fine particulate levels. Meanwhile, another cold front is forecast to move through far West Texas, the Texas Panhandle, the Permian Basin, and a portion of North Central Texas. The light density residual smoke combined with slightly elevated urban fine particulate aerosols, mainly over South Central, North Central, Northeast, and Southeast Texas, converging along and ahead of the leading edge of the cold frontal boundary, may result in slightly increased PM2.5 levels as the front approaches. The overall daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to rise to the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas and to the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-McAllen, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, and Victoria areas.... Slightly elevated urban fine particulate background levels over portions of far West Texas associated with light daytime winds and limited morning vertical mixing could raise the daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs to the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area.\n\nLight winds, warm temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels could be enough for ozone to reach the middle of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio areas; the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Tyler-Longview and Waco-Killeen areas; and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Laredo, Midland-Odessa, and Victoria areas.\n\nDepending on the movement and position of the aforementioned cold front, potential light density residual smoke attributed to possible small prescribed burning activities across parts of the Mississippi River Valley and East Texas filtering over East and Southeast Texas, combined with slightly elevated urban fine particulate aerosols over portions of South Central, North Central, Northeast, and Southeast Texas attributed to light morning winds, and slightly elevated urban fine particulate aerosols over portions of deep South Texas, the Coastal Plains, and Southeast Texas attributed to slightly elevated relative humidity levels may periodically raise the PM2.5 AQI to the \"Moderate\" range. Overall, the daily PM2.5 AQI may remain in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Brownsville-McAllen and Houston areas and should net out in the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.... Slightly elevated urban fine particulate background levels over portions of far West Texas associated with light daytime winds and limited morning vertical mixing could maintain the daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs at the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area.\n\nThis forecast was last updated at 11:15 AM on Friday, October 17th, and is updated daily on normal TCEQ workdays and may also be updated on weekends or holidays when air pollution levels are high.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... The large crater J. Herschel spans 96 miles and betrays its age in two ways. First, the poor rim has been long battered down by smaller impacts and has so many dents that the low-angle sunlight easily streams into the middle. And second, what would have been a complex jumble of central peaks lies buried under the immense amount of rubble thrown out by the giant impact that carved out the Imbrium basin. It looks like someone has kicked dirt on a key lime pie.\nCloser to the pole, the 44-mile-wide Philolaus has much younger features, most notably a sharp and tall rim that casts a long, dark shadow. Return for the next night or two to see its twin central peaks. Herschel may be unrecognizable by now. (Philolaus was a 5th-century Greek who followed Pythagoras and said that Earth was moving. John Herschel charted the southern sky.)\nYou can try again on Nov. 1st, with lighting 10 hours later than pictured here.\nMeteor Watch: Perfect conditions\nThe Orionid meteor shower peaks Oct. 21, although it is active between Oct. 2 and Nov. 7. This annual event is renowned for its swift, bright meteors that radiate from the constellation Orion, near the star Betelgeuse. Under optimal conditions — clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution — viewers can expect up to 20 meteors per hour in the predawn hours when the radiant is high in the sky. The radiant rises in the east before midnight and reaches its highest point in the sky around 5:30 a.m., making the early-morning hours ideal for observation. This year the New Moon on Oct. 21 ensures dark skies, enhancing visibility. To fully appreciate the spectacle, find a dark location, lie back, and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness.... Did a nova just appear below Saturn? Peaking up to 2nd magnitude, the larger geostationary satellites reflect sunlight from their solar panels. Lower satellites move across the sky, but for these big birds, the sky moves slowly past them. The time of peak brightness shifts about four minutes earlier each night.\nCeres spends all month within a short distance of several bright stars, aiding in its identification.

Moonlight will not interfere with observing. It is very close to a new Moon, so the Moon isn’t up for most observers for almost all of the night, and either dark or just the thinnest of crescents shortly before dawn.

            "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude.

It is defined as the closest Full Moon to autumnal (fall) equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAs well as being named after the harvest season in the northern half of the globe, the moonrise times around Full Moon at the autumnal equinox are favorable to getting in the harvest. This is because the difference in the time between moonrise from one night to the next becomes\n\n**less than the average of 50 minutes**. The result is that, for **several nights in a row, there’s extra moonlight in the evenings**. Historically, this gave farmers more time to harvest crops.\n\nThe opposite takes effect in the Southern Hemisphere around the September equinox with\n\n**more** than 50 minutes between moonrise from one day to the next around the Full Moon.... ## Two Meteor Showers in October\n\nMeteors, or shooting stars, are the bright streaks of light that occur when a meteoroid—a rock in space—hits our atmosphere and burns up. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid.\n\nOctober boasts two meteor showers: the\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaking around October 8–9, and the **Orionid meteor shower** peaking around October 20–21. The bad news is that the glare from the bright Full Moon will reduce the number of Draconids that are visible this year. The good news is that the Orionids peak close to New Moon, when the night sky is at its darkest.\n\nThe origin of the Draconids is the dust trail left by comet\n\n**21P/Giacobini-Zinner**. Meanwhile, the Orionids have a more famous parent body: **Halley’s Comet**. Have a look at our tips for watching meteor showers.\n\n## Coral Spawning Follows October Full Moon\n\nIn the days after Full Moon in October and November, corals in Australia’s\n\n**Great Barrier Reef** simultaneously release bundles of eggs and sperm into the sea. This phenomenon is called **coral spawning**.\n\nThe event only happens at night, and its timing hinges on a number of factors including Moon phase, water temperatures, salinity levels, and the length of day.\n\nIn the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the inshore reefs usually spawn in\n\n**October**; the outer reefs tend to spawn during **November** or **December**. Meanwhile at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Texas and Louisiana in the USA, coral spawning typically happens after the **August** Full Moon.... ## Mercury Makes a Bright Appearance\n\nMercury shines bright on October 29 as it reaches its\n\n**greatest elongation east**. In general, the days on either side of greatest elongations are the best time to catch the innermost planet in our solar system.\n\nBecause Mercury is small and lies close to the Sun, it can be a challenge to observe. But at greatest elongation east, there is a chance to see it with the naked eye soon after sunset.\n\nAnd the elusive Mercury tends to favor one or other of the hemispheres—this time stargazers in the\n\n**Southern Hemisphere** get the best view.\n\nThere will be a close approach of Mercury and Mars on\n\n**October 20**, seen here from Sydney, Australia, as the two planets set.\n\nAnd on\n\n**October 23**, the Waxing Crescent Moon will join Mercury and Mars—as seen here in Sydney at around 20:15 (8:15 pm) local time.\n\n**But beware:** Do not try to observe objects close to the Sun while any part of the Sun is above the horizon. Never point binoculars or a telescope in the direction of the Sun—it **can cause permanent eye damage**.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Which planets are in the night sky tonight?\n\nOur Interactive Night Sky Map gives the rise and set times for the planets in your town or city.... ## How many planets are there?\n\nAccording to the latest definition, there are 8 planets in our solar system.\n\n## How long does it take to get to Venus?\n\nA typical journey time is around four or five months.",

A Supermoon takes over, the Draconid meteor shower peeks through, and the Orionid meteors sparkle across the night sky.\nThe evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because - it's a supermoon!\nThis evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why?\nSupermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with \"perigee,\" which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month.\nSo this is an exceptionally close full moon! Which explains its spectacular appearance.\nAnd what timing - while the supermoon appears on October 6th, just a couple of days before on October 4th is \"International Observe the Moon Night\"!... It's an annual, worldwide event when Moon enthusiasts come together to enjoy our natural satellite.You can attend or host a moon-viewing party, or simply observe the Moon from wherever you are.\nSo look up, and celebrate the moon along with people all around the world!\nThe supermoon will light up the sky on October 6th, but if you luck into some dark sky between October 6th and 10th, you might witness the first of two October meteor showers - the Draconids!\nThe Draconid meteor shower comes from debris trailing the comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner burning up in Earth's atmosphere\nThese meteors originate from nearby the head of the constellation Draco the dragon in the northern sky and the shower can produce up to 10 meteors per hour!\nThe Draconids peak around October 8th, but if you don't see any, you can always blame the bright supermoon and wait a few weeks until the next meteor shower - the Orionids!\nThe Orionid meteor shower, peaking October 21, is set to put on a spectacular show, shooting about 20 meteors per hour across the night sky.\nThis meteor shower happens when Earth travels through the debris trailing behind Halley's Comet and it burns up in our atmosphere.... The full duration of the meteor shower stretches from September 26 to November 22, but your best bet to see meteors is on October 21 before midnight until around 2 am.\nThis is because, not only is this night the shower's peak, it is also the October new moon, meaning the moon will be between the Earth and the Sun, making it dark and invisible to us.\nWith a moonless sky, you're much more likely to catch a fireball careening through the night.\nSo find a dark location after the sun has set, look to the southeast sky (if you're in the northern hemisphere) and the northeast (if you're in the southern hemisphere) and enjoy!\nOrionid meteors appear to come from the direction of the Orion constellation but you might catch them all across the sky.\nHere are the phases of the Moon for October.\nYou can stay up to date on all of NASA's missions exploring the solar system and beyond at science.nasa.gov.",

            "snippet": "## Meteor Showers in Early and Late October\n\n### The Draconids – Dragon Meteors Under a Bright Moon\n\nThe\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaks around October 8, 2025, but this year the “Dragon” will have its fire stolen by moonlight. The Draconids are a minor shower (often only ~10 meteors per hour under dark skies [1]), and unfortunately a **full Moon on October 6–7** will flood the night sky with light during the peak [2]. The bright moonlight will wash out all but the brightest Draconid meteors, making them hard to spot. Best chance to catch a few “shooting stars” from Draco’s radiant (near the Dragon’s head in the northern sky) is *as soon as darkness falls* on October 8, before the Moon rises too high [3]. This unusual timing – evening instead of predawn – is because Draconid meteors fly in the early night hours (the shower’s radiant is highest in the sky at nightfall) [4].\n\nWhy bother with a faint shower? The Draconids are infamous for occasional\n\n**outbursts**. In rare years, if Earth passes through a dense clump of debris from the shower’s parent comet (21P/Giacobini-Zinner), the Draconids have surprised observers with hundreds or even thousands of meteors per hour (notably in 1933 and 1946) [5] [6]. Most years are quiet, but the comet did reach perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in March 2025, raising the *possibility* of enhanced activity [7] [8]. “Watch out if the Dragon awakes!” writes one skywatching columnist – that slim chance of a meteor storm keeps many enthusiasts outdoors **even in moonlight** during this shower [9]. While a storm is not expected, keep an eye on the northern sky on October 8–9 just in case. (The Draconids favor observers in the **Northern Hemisphere**; those far south won’t see much, as Draco sits low or below the horizon.)... ### The Orionids – Halley’s Comet’s Encore\n\nLater in the month comes the\n\n**Orionid meteor shower**, peaking on the night of October 21–22, 2025. The Orionids are debris from the famous **Halley’s Comet** and are known for fast, fine meteors. In a typical year, the Orionid shower produces about **20 meteors per hour at peak under clear dark skies** [10]. Some years have surged higher (50–70 per hour in exceptional displays), but recently Orionids have been modest, around 20–30 per hour [11]. Fortunately, conditions in 2025 will be *nearly ideal*: the peak falls under a **new Moon**, so **no moonlight will interfere** [12]. In fact, the Moon will be only ~2% illuminated and rises near dawn, essentially leaving the late-night sky perfectly dark [13] [14] for meteor spotting.\n\nThe best time to watch is\n\n**after midnight until pre-dawn** on Oct. 21/22, once the constellation Orion (the shower’s radiant near Orion’s Club) climbs high. Orionids are swift – striking Earth almost head-on at 66 km/s – which often yields long, quick streaks [15]. They can appear anywhere in the sky, so find a dark location, lie back, and scan around Orion and the neighboring constellations. This shower is visible from both the **Northern and Southern Hemispheres**, as Orion straddles the celestial equator [16] [17]. NASA notes that the Orionids’ parent, Halley’s Comet, also causes the Eta Aquariids in May – making Halley “a two-for-one deal” for meteor fans each year [18]. With no Moon to spoil the show in 2025, **experts predict excellent viewing conditions**, so this could be one of the top meteor showers of the year [19].... ## Planetary Highlights and Conjunctions\n\nOctober 2025 offers plenty of planet spotting opportunities. Two bright planets,... **at peak brilliance**in these weeks – astronomers rate it around magnitude –4.5, the brightest it gets all year [48] [49]. **Tip:**after observing Venus and the Moon, scan higher up for fainter **Mars**(see below) and toward the west for Jupiter setting at dawn. **Mercury and Mars at Dusk:**Fleet-footed **Mercury**makes a challenging appearance in late October. On **October 29**, Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation, 23° away from the Sun in the evening sky [50]. This is actually Mercury’s *last*evening apparition of 2025, but it’s not particularly favorable for those in the Northern Hemisphere. Even at maximum separation, Mercury will be low in the bright twilight (it sets shortly after the Sun). Still, around the final week of October, persistent observers might catch Mercury as a faint “star” very low on the **west-southwest horizon**about 30–45 minutes after sunset [51]. Binoculars will help you spot it in the glow. (Observers in the Southern Hemisphere get a slightly better viewing angle, so Mercury will be a bit higher for them.) Intriguingly, **Mars**is also lurking in the same area of sky. Mars, now on the far side of the Sun and very faint, has been sinking into the sunset glare each evening. Around **October 19–23**, Mercury and Mars actually pass each other in what would be a *conjunction*– but this happens so deep in twilight that it’s a tough observation. Mercury is emerging upward from solar conjunction while Mars is vanishing downward into it, so they are both extremely low after sunset [52]. High Point Scientific notes this pairing gives a brief opportunity to see the two planets close together as they trade places relative to the Sun [53]. If you have a **very clear view of the western horizon**on Oct. 19–20, you might attempt a sighting: about 15–20 minutes after sunset, scan for Mercury (the brighter of the two) and see if you can also glimpse dim Mars nearby. Realistically, Mars will likely be invisible without a telescope. By early November, Mars is in conjunction with the Sun and gone. So think of this as **Mercury’s farewell to Mars**in the twilight – a symbolic handoff from one planet to the other.... ## Comets and Cosmic Visitors\n\nComet enthusiasts have much to be excited about in late 2025. October brings the potential for... *(Comet source refs: StarWalk/Starry Night guides [88] [89] [90]; NASA Science [91] [92]; Chron/EarthSky for context [93].)*... ## Auroras on the Rise – Eyes North (or South)!\n\nHigh-latitude skywatchers should stay alert this October for\n\n**aurora borealis** (Northern Lights) or aurora australis (Southern Lights). Solar activity is near its 11-year peak in 2025 – in fact, the Sun’s **solar maximum** is predicted for around July 2025 [94]. That means the Sun is freckled with sunspots and prone to eruptions like flares and coronal mass ejections, which send charged particles hurtling toward Earth. When those particles strike our atmosphere, they trigger the glowing curtains of auroras. The past year has already seen an uptick in auroral displays, and experts say 2025 will continue the trend [95] [96]. *“Aurora activity can often peak after solar maximum, meaning that the next couple of years will likely be an exciting time for aurora watchers,”* notes Dr. Renate Mauland-Hus, an astrophysicist interviewed by TimeandDate [97].\n\nOctober (along with the spring) is traditionally an excellent season for auroras because of the\n\n**equinox effect** – for reasons still being studied, geomagnetic disturbances seem to be more frequent around the equinoxes. With the **nights growing longer** in October, any geomagnetic storm has more hours of darkness to be observed. In practical terms, this means if the Sun belches out a strong Earth-directed solar flare or CME in September/October, auroras could potentially be visible farther from the poles than usual. Already in late 2024 and early 2025, auroras have been sighted at unusually low latitudes during big solar storms [98]. So if you live in **northern Europe, Canada, the northern U.S.** or similarly high latitudes (or the far southern hemisphere equivalents), keep an eye on space weather alerts. A good resource is NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center aurora forecasts or local observatory announcements.... With a little planning, October 2025 could be an unforgettable month of skywatching. From the eerie\n\n**Draconid meteors**under an autumn sky, to the crisp mornings with **Venus and the crescent Moon**, to the spectacle of a **Harvest supermoon**, there’s a bounty of cosmic wonders to enjoy. So bundle up, find a dark sky if you can, and **enjoy the show** – the universe is putting on one nightly above us.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... Pacific Coast observers will see the pair of shadows at the onset of morning twilight Oct. 25, the last in this series for the month.\nVenus rises at 5 a.m. local daylight time on Oct. 1, shining at magnitude –3.9 among the stars of Leo. It crosses into Virgo by the 9th and its elongation from the Sun is declining, so it rises later each morning. It's joined by the waning crescent Moon on the 19th; the pair rises around 5:30 a.m. across North America. They stand less than 4° apart, with the Moon just two days from New. Through a telescope, Venus displays a 94-percent-lit disk spanning 11″.\nBy the end of October, the phase expands to 96 percent and the disk shrinks to 10″. On the 31st Venus stands 4° north of Spica, although the magnitude 1.0 star is difficult to see in the brightening sky.\nNote: Moon phases in the calendar vary in size due to the distance from Earth and are shown at 0h Universal Time.

In the south lie the elongated Schiller and the detail-packed Gassendi; the equator sports the small and sharp Kepler, leading north to the outstanding half-ring of the Jura Mountains. Keep going north for some lunar history.... Did a nova just appear below Saturn? Peaking up to 2nd magnitude, the larger geostationary satellites reflect sunlight from their solar panels. Lower satellites move across the sky, but for these big birds, the sky moves slowly past them.

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:323} an incredible 29 years to race around that track as if it was a horse track in a racetrack. We go around naturally, you\n{ts:330} know, in one year. So looking at Saturn, you may get to see with a do, you know, decent sized telescope a ring system\n{ts:337} that's maybe deployed five or six degrees. We're beginning to see the southern section of the ring as years go\n{ts:343} on. So, don't miss Saturn, a beautiful site deep in the constellation of Aquarius, the water bearer. But for\n{ts:351} other objects, you probably want to look into the eastern part of the sky right after midnight because Jupiter rises,\n{ts:359} the god of gods and the most magnificent planet. And in the early morning sky, Venus is still there. As we look into\n{ts:366} our skies, we see it into the northnortheast before sunrise. The blazing object. Venus is an incredible\n{ts:373} object. Did you know, and I've often mentioned this on the Dr. Sky Experience, that under certain\n{ts:378} conditions, if let's say you live in an area where snow is pretty much uh, you know, prominent, you can actually see... {ts:385} your shadow by the brilliance of Venus. Now, you may wonder, how could that be? Well, if you're in a snowy field because\n{ts:390} of the whiteness of snow and Venus was, of course, you're staring at it and you turned around under super dark\n{ts:397} conditions, you might get to see your shadow, not just like the moon would cast your shadow or the sun in the\n{ts:403} daytime, but the planet Venus itself, which is quite interesting. So, ladies and gentlemen, a good opportunity now to\n{ts:410} talk about a pair of binoculars. Now, I get this question on the Dr. I experience all the time. And you can\n{ts:415} email me with your questions at just drsky at wabcradio.com.\n{ts:421} I'm there for you to answer questions and no question is foolish. I mean, we get questions and help people out.\n{ts:426} That's what we do to explore the mysteries of the universe. So, a pair of binoculars, let's talk about it for a\n{ts:433} moment. You use both eyes. Hopefully, your eyes are in good health. And even if they... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

            "snippet": "{ts:4} [Music] Hello. It's October. Only three more\n{ts:11} months to the end of 20125 and I am just gobsmacked. It's going by so fast. So, let's dive into what you can expect for\n{ts:19} October. Now, I don't know about you, but I feel like September was kind of a doozy. So, let's see what is in store\n{ts:27} for us. And I'm going to again say thank you to the ladies at the wholeness network for having me do their monthly\n{ts:36} um astrological uh series here. And I can't find my advance here. Here we go. Okay. So I love the great blue\n{ts:50} heron. I was uh texting with a friend about the great blue heron and I went on a 12mi run in a Kyhoga Valley National\n{ts:58} Park and I saw this blue heron on a tree stump sticking out of the marsh with his wings like this and and I took several\n{ts:67} pictures of him. He was sleeping and I hadn't put my phone on mute so he kind of like woke up and stuck his little... {ts:74} face out. He's like it was really interesting. So, the great blue heron is amazing and beautiful and things in\n{ts:81} nature can just bring us joy all the time because the natural world is indeed special and magical. So, we didn't\n{ts:88} really cover Libra season uh when I did the September preview because there's so much going on in September. So, we're\n{ts:97} going to talk about that now. So, Libra season is basically from September 22nd, uh, when the sun moves\n{ts:107} into the sign of Libra, we start fall. It's when the autumn equinox happens. Equal light, equal day. And we know what\n{ts:114} that means. The winter solstice is next. And that means the sun has its shortest days. It's kind of that time where we go\n{ts:122} inside and bed things down. So, right now, we're harvesting. We're getting all our stuff\n{ts:128} in. we're kind of preparing for the long dark days and Libra season as we know is symbolized by the scale. Um and it's\n{ts:136} kind of like if you think of the horizon, the sun dipping down, it... 's managing our needs and\n{ts:278} managing the needs of other people with grace. So there's this cooperation in leadership. there's this um taking in\n{ts:286} all the different aspects so that the highest good can be undertaken. Full moons typically are something\n{ts:293} that's revealing. It's it's a celebration. So see if there's some areas of your life um that are kind of\n{ts:300} you know with your relationships or how you assert yourself in the world that might be coming highlighted for you\n{ts:305} during this time. and everybody's chart's personal. But one thing I thought was kind of interesting uh is\n{ts:311} that Mercury is at 0 degrees Scorpio and it's in a quinc con with Neptune. And Mercury and Neptune is an interesting\n{ts:321} combination where uh it can affect how we perceive the world. Um sometimes Neptune can be incredibly spiritual and\n{ts:328} creative. Uh other times it can be confusing or disillusionment. And so it's Mercury is our mind and how we\n{ts:336} perceive things. So if you are someone who is working on um meditation, channeling, uh mediumship, stuff like\n{ts:344} that, psychism, like this could be a really interesting time for you to set that as an intention to really expand... {ts:349} that in your life. Also, if you're like a fantasy writer, mystery writer, um create creative writing in general, or\n{ts:358} even if you're someone who is a poet, uh does automatic writing, this could be really interesting for you as well. So,\n{ts:364} see how those things uh kind of work for you. And then there's also this um Quinn Kunk to Uranus. And Uranus is a god of\n{ts:372} lightning, sudden understanding. Uh it's kind of like a higher octave of Mercury some\n{ts:379} people say. So you could have like really great flashes of insight. Uh so kind of opening up the space for you to\n{ts:386} either be transfused with something amazing like with Neptune being a sort of tuning fork to your head or amazing\n{ts:394} lightning striking with fabulous ideas that you never would have thought of because it's so out of the box. So\n{ts:400} opening up the space for that to see what might happen for you could be fun. And going on to the next thing is we\n{ts:408} have Pluto. Uh it went retrograde May 4th of 2005 and it... 's been 162 days Pluto's been\n{ts:417} retrograde to us our viewpoint and it's now going direct and that's at one degree Aquarius. So when Pluto goes\n{ts:426} backwards it's time for us to kind of take the lessons that we've learned. See how uh I I put these up as a a nice\n{ts:435} visual because I'm I'm starting to think of Pluto as like this forge. It's we don't want to be melted typically, but\n{ts:444} it's like once we're melted, we're pliable. We're in this state of becoming something different. And when\n{ts:452} they used to make swords and whatnot, they would they would put this metal into a forge and\n{ts:458} heat it up and then make these swords and then beat them. And so Pluto transits can sometimes feel like that\n{ts:465} for us where it's like I wouldn't have chosen this for myself, but once the process is done, we're like super\n{ts:472} strong. And I also um put up a pressure cooker because it's I just saw a thing recently where\n{ts:480} someone said the Pluto glyph it's a circle and there's this half crescent and then the cross of matter and it... 's\n{ts:487} almost like someone's like surrendering. They're putting their hands up like this. And so there's an element of\n{ts:493} surrender when Pluto is talking to us or is involved in our chart somehow. And it's it's like our it's not always a\n{ts:502} comfortable feeling to be in a catalyst or a crucible, which is kind of what I feel like with a pressure cooker is, but\n{ts:509} it's it changes us and then we move forward with a totally different perspective on things. So, as Pluto\n{ts:515} starts to go direct now, um the themes of Pluto being in Aquarius will kind of move forward with such things. So, I... {ts:523} know AI has just been huge. It's interesting because uh my uncle worked with IBM for years and he said really AI\n{ts:530} is a program written by a human essentially as the way it is right now the large language model and things like\n{ts:537} that. So, it's may we write programs that are full of love and higher higher um uh purposes\n{ts:548} and for the higher good of everything and kind of avoid anything that might be negative with with those things. So I\n{ts:555} think I just want to say that for for that because Pluto and Aquarius um sometimes it can be like dystopian or we\n{ts:562} always know it's going to be uh but it feels like information and things like that is one of the things that Pluto\n{ts:568} could be talking with with us with it going into Aquarius and power to the people definitely power with people and\n{ts:574} masses of people and grassroots and all that kind of stuff. Oh, I didn't get rid of my drawing. Sorry. Then we have the\n{ts:583} um new moon in Libra and this is happening at 28° Libra. So if you have late degree... {ts:662} Mars loves Scorpio. It it's the rulership is a doicile of Mars um in the nighttime and it's really a powerful\n{ts:671} sign for Mars to be in. So it's easier for Mars to express itself and Mars is our desire, our aggression, how we go\n{ts:677} after what we want, energy, drive, ambition with it right next to Mercury. uh in the previous um full moon we saw\n{ts:686} that Mercury is being aspected by Mercury is aspecting Uranus and Neptune and now we have Mars there. So Mars kind\n{ts:694} of gives this ability to be witty and sharp, incisive uh if you are talking with somebody, watching the potential\n{ts:706} inflammatory aspect like argument potential, but it's also um like like having like something important to say\n{ts:714} and saying it. And I think with the the Libra can kind of bring in that niceness where we can temper it a smidge. Uh but\n{ts:721} seeing how you uh can be clear-cut in your thinking, clearcut in how you're speaking with people and\n{ts:730} could potentially be a little argumentative here and there because Mars can be spicy. I mean definitely",

            "snippet": "October brings some of the most pronounced seasonal changes to our nighttime skygazing. The sounds and smells of summer have passed on, But, with the distinct scent of autumn leaves and the absence of the frogs, katydids, and all but perhaps few enough crickets to count, the still nights of autumn are getting longer, cooler, and quieter.\n\nIn the west, we see Arcturus, the brilliant star that foretells the coming of spring, and has been a presence in our evening sky since, is now low in the sky, soon to trade places to the morning sky.\n\nAs we continue to anticipate the once-in-80-year outburst of the Blaze Star, T Coronae Borealis, we have less time to observe the star during October, as it is getting lower in the northwest after sunset, sets during the mid-to-late evening, and doesn’t rise before the onset of morning twilight until about a week into November.\n\nLooking towards the south, we find our gaze turning away from the glow of the Milky Way, and towards the dimmer constellations of autumn. While Capricornus, Aquarius, Cetus, and Pisces are relatively devoid of bright stars, one notable exception is Pisces Austrinus, which gives us the lone first magnitude star, Fomalhaut, a class A3 main sequence star that lies just 25 light years away. Lying 59° east-southeast from the next-nearest first magnitude star, Altair, Fomalhaut is the most isolated of the first magnitude stars in our sky from our latitude of about 42° north.... ## Moon\n\nTo start the month of October, the 69.9% waxing gibbous Moon is just 0.8° east-southeast of Pluto on the 1st. This pairing would be quite an observing challenge, as the Moon is about 16 billion times brighter than Pluto. Capturing it photographically with a sensitive imaging device is a bit more feasible. If you can observe the two objects simultaneously, consider that Pluto’s light took four hours 51 minutes to reach us, and that the distant dwarf planet is 13,329 times the distance from Earth as the Moon.\n\nOctober 4th is International Observe the Moon Night, but this year we’ll be celebrating on Sunday the 5th. Watch the 98% waxing gibbous Moon rise at 5:34pm over the Seekonk River with Skyscrapers members and friends from Blackstone Field on the East Side of Providence, adjacent to the Narragansett Boat Club on River Drive. Bring a telescope, binoculars, or a camera, and enjoy the moonrise with us. The Moon will be just 2.2° north-northwest of Saturn on this evening. A few hours later, early on the morning of the 6th, the Moon is 1.8° north-northwest of Neptune. Throughout the evening, you should be able to observe all three objects simultaneously in a small telescope with a wide field of view.... The Moon is full at 11:48pm on the 6th, marking 2025’s Harvest Moon, as October’s full Moon is 14.5 hours closer to the equinox than September’s full Moon. The Harvest Moon is in Pisces, and rises at 5:57pm, when the Sun is still above the horizon, making this full Moon rise a very favorable one to photograph.\n\nWe have missed the last several occurrences of it, either because it happens during daylight for us, or the Moon is below the horizon, but October gives us our first nighttime view of the Moon occulting the Pleiades.\n\nThe first of the brighter members, Celaeno (16 Tauri), is occulted beginning at 11:36pm on the 9th. Electra (17 Tauri) is occulted about three minutes later. At 11:54pm, Taygeta (19 Tauri) dips behind the bright limb of the Moon, followed by Maia (20 Tauri) at 12:04am on the 10th.\n\nElectra emerges at 12:19am, followed by Celaeno at 12:39am, Taygeta at 12:58am, and Maia at 1:08am.\n\nThe Moon reaches its most northerly declination during lunation 1271 on the 12th, at +28.27° in the non-zodiacal constellation Auriga.... ## Mercury\n\nMercury spends October in its least favorable evening apparition of the year for northern hemisphere observers. While it reaches its maximum elongation of 23.9° east of the Sun on the 29th, it never spends more than an hour above the horizon following sunset, during which time it remains low over the southwestern horizon.\n\nDue to Mercury’s inclination angle keeping it south of the ecliptic, which is already at a low angle of incidence during October evenings, the planet doesn’t gain considerable elevation over the horizon, but continues to appear further towards the south each evening.\n\nIf you’re searching for Mercury on the 2nd, you may notice magnitude 1.0 Spica, which lies 1.7° to the south-southwest of the magnitude -0.5 planet.\n\nThe innermost planet joins the Moon and Mars, with the three appearing in a line on the 23rd. You’ll be able to locate the 5.3% crescent moon first, then, with binoculars, go 3.9° to the north-northeast, or right and slightly above, to find Mercury. Then, continue along this direction another 3.0° to locate Mars.\n\n## Venus\n\nVenus is now over 1.5 au from Earth, moving along the far side of its orbit towards superior conjunction in early January. It is visible low in the eastern sky before sunrise, rising about 2½ minutes later each morning. Its gibbous disk has shrunk to just about 11 arcseconds, but the planet still retains its brilliance at magnitude -3.9.\n\nVenus crosses into Virgo on the 9th.\n\nOn the 19th, the super slim crescent Moon is just 4.1° southwest of Venus.... ## Saturn\n\nOctober’s evening skies offer Saturn as the only bright planet in an optimal position for viewing. Moving retrograde through Aquarius, the ringed planet can be found in the southeastern sky after twilight fades.\n\nOn the 5th, the nearly full Moon is just 2.2° to the north-northwest of Saturn, and with a wide field telescope, you’ll be able to see not just the Moon and Saturn, but also Neptune, which is 2.0° to the east of the Moon.\n\n**Moons of Saturn**\n\nThe last of Titan’s shadow transits visible to us begins at 12:26am on the 6th, when the shadow of Saturn’s giant moon grazes the northern limb of the planet, departing after 1:42am. As this is still relatively close to Saturn’s opposition, there is also a coinciding transit of the moon itself, beginning at 9:25pm on the 5th, ending at 1:44am on the 6th.\n\nWhile the next shadow transit of Titan will not occur until 2038, the moon itself continues to transit the planet's disk a few more times, and keen observers with larger instruments, exceptionally good observing conditions, and sensitive image equipment may be able to track Saturn’s smaller, inner moons as they continue to cast shadows across the planet’s cloudtops throughout the next several months.\n\nTitan enters occultation at 6:57pm on the 13th, during nautical twilight. It remains behind Saturn and in eclipse until 12:50am.\n\nAnother transit of Titan, without its shadow, takes place on the 21st, beginning at 6:45pm. The moon takes nearly six hours to cross Saturn’s northern equatorial belt.\n\nOn the 29th, Titan emerges from occultation at 10:22pm while partially eclipsed. It comes out of eclipse a few minutes past midnight on the 30th.\n\nTitan comes out of eclipse at 00:00pm on the 29th.... ## Comets\n\n**C/2025 R2 (SWAN)**\n\nDiscovered on September 11, 2025 in images captured with the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument onboard NASA’s Solar and Heliophysics Observatory (SOHO), Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN is in our evening sky throughout October, hovering around 9th magnitude before fading rapidly as it moves out of the inner solar system.\n\nOn the 2nd, it is just 1.0° from Zubenelgenubi (alpha Librae).\n\nOn the 13th, it lies 0.8° south of Sabik (eta Ophiuchi), and on the 17th, it is 1.0° south of Messier 16 in Serpens.\n\nThe comet is nearest to Earth on the 19th, at a distance of 0.261 au, during which time it is moving at a rate of 4.7° per day\n\n**C/2025 A6 Lemmon**\n\nComet C/2025 A6 Lemmon is visible in the northern sky during October.\n\nOn the 6th and 7th, it is located close to Tania Australis (mu Ursae Majoris), the southern star of the middle pair of the Three Leaps of the Gazelle asterism. This part of the sky sets early in the evening, but is once again easy to view in the northeast after 1:00am. The comet may be visible in binoculars, at about magnitude 8.",

            "snippet": "# What's in the sky October 2025\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nWelcome to your October guide to the Southern Hemisphere night sky! This month, we’ve got a fantastic mix of planets, deep sky objects, and even a rare comet to chase. Whether you’re a casual stargazer enjoying the view with binoculars, a telescope enthusiast hunting planets and nebulae, or an astrophotographer capturing the wonders above, there’s plenty to see and explore. From bright planets like Saturn and Mercury to stunning deep sky gems like the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Helix Nebula, October promises plenty of celestial highlights to keep your nights busy.\n\n**Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN**\n\nThis month brings a rare visitor from the outer Solar System: Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, which reaches its closest approach on October 19th, just 0.261 AU from Earth. Last seen in the inner Solar System over 20,000 years ago.\n\nImage Credit: Mike Kane\n\nAfter perihelion on September 12, it developed a striking 5° corkscrew-shaped ion tail visible in photographs. That’s about the length of 10 Full Moons! Currently around magnitude 6, it’s visible with binoculars low on the western horizon just after sunset. Look near Mars and Spica in Virgo to help spot it. As it approaches Earth, it may brighten to magnitude 4, possibly making it visible to the naked eye under dark skies.. This closest approach is due to happen on the 19... th of October, so pencil in the days between the 18 th till the 21 st, as that will hopefully be one of the best opportunities this year to observe a comet. The comet will continue moving through Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius before fading in early November.\n\nAnd since comets can surprise us with sudden changes in brightness or appearance, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN. Look out for an updated video and article from us right before the best viewing nights so you’ll know exactly what to expect and how to spot it.\n\n**Mercury**\n\nThis month, we’ve also got the 2\n\nnd best opportunity of the year to observe Mercury, as it reaches its greatest elongation on the 29 th of October. This is when Mercury reaches it’s greatest distance in the sky from the Sun and makes it the best time to observe the planet.\n\nThe greatest elongation of the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is kind of like their version of opposition. It’s not quite the same, as it’s not when the planet is at it’s largest, but it represents the best opportunity to observe the planet, as it signifies when the planet appears to be the farthest distance form the sun in our sky.... If you don’t have an opportunity to observe on exactly the 29\n\nth, don’t worry! While planetary opposition and elongation events are typically given as just one date, the truth is that while this date represents the absolute peak, observing up to a week before or after is often 90% as good! So don’t think you’ve missed out, you haven’t!\n\n**Saturn**\n\nSpeaking of opposition, while Saturn’s opposition has already passed, secretly we actually think now may be a better time to observe. Why? Because while Saturn is ever so slightly smaller than last month, it’s rising earlier in the night, making it easier to observe for those of us keen to maintain a reasonable bedtime!\n\nWhile the best viewing window is still a little late, between 10 and 12pm, you’ll still get great views of the planet anytime after sunset, and Saturn should be fairly easy to spot in the Northeastern area of the sky.\n\n**Neptune**\n\nOnce again Neptune joins us alongside Saturn in the Sky. If you’ve got a scope big enough (we’d typically recommend and aperture of 6 inches or larger), and you can See Saturn in the sky, then you’ll be able to spot Neptune. There’s not much worth looking at in it’s own right, but if you’re already observing Saturn, you may as well turn your scope to the furthest planet in the Solar system.... Like Saturn, Neptune is best observed between 10-12pm, but you’ll be able to see it anytime after sunset.\n\nIf you’re up late, this month also represents a good time to have a look at Uranus. Again if you’ve got the aperture, you’ll see a tiny grey-blue disk. This month it’s really only for the most dedicated planet hunters, as to have a good view of it, you’ll need to be up between 1-3am, as that’s when it’s best positioned for observing in the sky.... ###\n\n**Uranus**\n\n**Deep Sky Objects This Month**\n\n**The Small Magellanic Cloud/SMC (NGC 292)**\n\nThe main attraction this month is one of the gems of the Southern sky, The Small Magellanic cloud. While it doesn’t take up as much of the sky as it’s cousin the Large Magellanic cloud (more on this incredible object come January), there’s nothing Small about this cloud of stars, as it stretches 4 degrees across in the sky (that’s 8 moons across!).\n\nImage Credit: ESO/VISTA VMC\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud, or SMC for short is a satellite galaxy of the Milkyway, meaning the SMC orbits the Milky way much in a similar way to how the Moon orbits the Earth! It’s exclusively visible to us in the southern hemisphere, and is easily one of the gems of the southern sky.\n\nThe SMC is visible to the naked eye from dark sites with little light pollution, and in fact is one of the furthest objects visible with the naked eye, at a distance of 200,000 light years away. Up the magnification and light gathering with a pair of Binoculars and the SMC will stand out even more, and you’ll also be able to make out some of the details of the galaxy itself. Up the Magnification and light gathering even more with a large telescope, and individual features within the SMC become resolvable.... Another great target this month is NGC 7293, the Helix Nebula. Often also known by the much more dramatic name, the Eye of God Nebula, the Helix Nebula is one of the closest Planetary Nebula to Earth, which makes it one of the rare planetary Nebula in the sky large enough to make out considerable detail through a telescope, as well as being large enough to be a great target astrophotography target for small refractors and Smart telescopes.\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nThrough the eyepiece, you’ll see an eye shape staring right back, and you’ll see more details the darker your sky, and if you have a UHC filter like this one to boost contrast: https://bintel.com.au/products/astronomik-uhc-filter.\n\nPlanetary nebulae like the Helix are formed during the final stages of a medium-sized star’s life. When stars similar in size to our Sun exhaust the fuel in their cores, they shed their outer layers into space, creating an expanding shell of glowing gas. The exposed hot core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation that excites the surrounding gas, causing it to shine in the striking colours we see in photographs. Planetary nebulae aren’t uncommon in the galaxy, but the Helix is special because it’s one of the closest and brightest, making its structure and details much easier to observe.... The Helix Nebula is another quintessentially Southern object. While it is technically observable from the Northern Hemisphere, they don’t get to see it quite like we do, as we get to see it rise right overhead in the night sky.\n\nYou’ll find the Helix nebula in the constellation Aquarius, and it’s best observed between 8 to 10pm, when its at its highest in the night sky.\n\nAnd that brings an end to this month’s guide to the night sky. October offers an incredible variety of observing opportunities for Southern Hemisphere stargazers. From the bright planets like Saturn, Mercury, and Neptune, to a rare visitor from the outer Solar System in Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, there’s something for every type of observer, no matter if you’re up late hunting faint outer planets or enjoying a relaxed evening spotting a comet low on the horizon. The deep sky is equally rewarding, with the Small Magellanic Cloud and its internal treasures like NGC 346, as well as the Helix Nebula, giving both visual observers and astrophotographers stunning targets to explore. With clear skies, dark horizons, and a mix of familiar and extraordinary objects, October is shaping up to be a month that truly showcases the richness of our southern night sky.",

Moonlight will not interfere with observing. It is very close to a new Moon, so the Moon isn’t up for most observers for almost all of the night, and either dark or just the thinnest of crescents shortly before dawn.

            "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude. Located inside the border are the cardinal directions and their intermediate points. To find stars, hold the map overhead and orient it so one of the labels matches the direction you’re facing.

It is defined as the closest Full Moon to autumnal (fall) equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAs well as being named after the harvest season in the northern half of the globe, the moonrise times around Full Moon at the autumnal equinox are favorable to getting in the harvest. This is because the difference in the time between moonrise from one night to the next becomes\n\n**less than the average of 50 minutes**. The result is that, for **several nights in a row, there’s extra moonlight in the evenings**. Historically, this gave farmers more time to harvest crops.\n\nThe opposite takes effect in the Southern Hemisphere around the September equinox with\n\n**more** than 50 minutes between moonrise from one day to the next around the Full Moon.... ## Two Meteor Showers in October\n\nMeteors, or shooting stars, are the bright streaks of light that occur when a meteoroid—a rock in space—hits our atmosphere and burns up. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid.\n\nOctober boasts two meteor showers: the\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaking around October 8–9, and the **Orionid meteor shower** peaking around October 20–21. The bad news is that the glare from the bright Full Moon will reduce the number of Draconids that are visible this year. The good news is that the Orionids peak close to New Moon, when the night sky is at its darkest.\n\nThe origin of the Draconids is the dust trail left by comet\n\n**21P/Giacobini-Zinner**. Meanwhile, the Orionids have a more famous parent body: **Halley’s Comet**. Have a look at our tips for watching meteor showers.\n\n## Coral Spawning Follows October Full Moon\n\nIn the days after Full Moon in October and November, corals in Australia’s\n\n**Great Barrier Reef** simultaneously release bundles of eggs and sperm into the sea. This phenomenon is called **coral spawning**.\n\nThe event only happens at night, and its timing hinges on a number of factors including Moon phase, water temperatures, salinity levels, and the length of day.\n\nIn the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the inshore reefs usually spawn in\n\n**October**; the outer reefs tend to spawn during **November** or **December**. Meanwhile at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Texas and Louisiana in the USA, coral spawning typically happens after the **August** Full Moon.... ## Mercury Makes a Bright Appearance\n\nMercury shines bright on October 29 as it reaches its\n\n**greatest elongation east**. In general, the days on either side of greatest elongations are the best time to catch the innermost planet in our solar system.\n\nBecause Mercury is small and lies close to the Sun, it can be a challenge to observe. But at greatest elongation east, there is a chance to see it with the naked eye soon after sunset.\n\nAnd the elusive Mercury tends to favor one or other of the hemispheres—this time stargazers in the\n\n**Southern Hemisphere** get the best view.\n\nThere will be a close approach of Mercury and Mars on\n\n**October 20**, seen here from Sydney, Australia, as the two planets set.\n\nAnd on\n\n**October 23**, the Waxing Crescent Moon will join Mercury and Mars—as seen here in Sydney at around 20:15 (8:15 pm) local time.\n\n**But beware:** Do not try to observe objects close to the Sun while any part of the Sun is above the horizon. Never point binoculars or a telescope in the direction of the Sun—it **can cause permanent eye damage**.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Which planets are in the night sky tonight?\n\nOur Interactive Night Sky Map gives the rise and set times for the planets in your town or city.... ## How many planets are there?\n\nAccording to the latest definition, there are 8 planets in our solar system.\n\n## How long does it take to get to Venus?\n\nA typical journey time is around four or five months.",

Email Greg your space questions and he might answer them in the next edition.**\n\nWelcome to WTOP’s monthly feature, “What’s up in the sky?” Each month it features the best the sky has to offer stargazers regarding the moon, planets and stars. Space-related events that might interest you taking place in the D.C. area are included as well.\n\nLet’s get to the sky for October 2025!\n\n**Must-see sky sights for October**\n\nDuring October 2025, Venus continues to be the “Morning Star” in the east before dawn, albeit lower in the sky but still bright. The beautiful and bright winter constellations keep Venus celestial company making for a wondrous sky sight. The moon joins up with Venus too for a must-see sky sight.\n\nThe zodiacal light will be visible in the eastern pre-dawn sky for about two weeks starting on the 19th.\n\nThe Orionid Meteor Shower will happen on the night of Oct. 20-21.\n\n**Star of the month:** **Algol **\n\nIn October, be on the lookout for Algol — the “Demon Star” — so named because of its regular change in brightness. Algol is a variable star that undergoes very regular intervals between its maximum and minimum brightness. You can use this tool to determine when Algol will be at its dimmest for several hours.... It is quite intriguing to watch the star change brightness. You can try imaging this process as well with your camera/smartphone.\n\n**Highlights of the month**\n\nOn Oct. 1 in the southwest, the center and brightest part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, is visible for a few hours after dark before it sets. You need a dark sky site and a moonless night to see the Milky Way at its best.\n\nAs October begins, the Summer Triangle is high overhead with the Milky Way running through it as it flows across the sky to the northeast. As the night heads into the hours before dawn, the “Winter Milky Way” is visible in the southeast to the northwest. You can see the Milky Way with a smartphone and/or camera by taking time exposures. For the best results, use a tripod.\n\n**Oct. 4:** International Observe the Moon Night is on this night. Check out the website for information on events, and of course, the moon!\n\n**Oct. 5:** As it gets dark, Saturn and the almost full moon rise in the east — a mere two degrees apart.\n\n**Oct. 6:** The full harvest supermoon is at 11:47 p.m. Eastern Time and rises at sunset in the East. This is the first full supermoon of 2025 and the largest and brightest full moon of 2025. Should be a grand sight at sunset! Get your smartphone/camera ready.... **Oct. 9:** Starting at 11:30 p.m. and lasting for about 2.5 hours, the bright moon passes through the Pleiades star cluster late in the evening covering, or occulting, some of the stars. Binoculars will enhance the view.\n\n**Oct. 19:** A must see in the pre-dawn sky in the east is the very old, waning crescent moon with Earthshine joining up with Venus at just four degrees apart. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.\n\n**Oct. 19:** While looking at the moon and Venus, be on the lookout for the zodiacal light. For about two weeks, it will be visible in the northern hemisphere in the eastern pre-dawn sky, and for the southern hemisphere in the west after sunset. You will need a dark sky site and clear horizon to see this ghostly pyramid shape in the sky. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.\n\n**Night of Oct. 20-21:** The Orionid Meteor Shower graces our dark, moonless sky. Under these sky conditions, the Orionids exhibit a maximum of about 10-20 meteors per hour.\n\n**Oct. 24:** If you have a straight line horizon in the southwest with no obstructions, at twilight look to the southwest to see the young waxing crescent moon very near Antares. To the lower right and just above the horizon Mercury and dimmer Mars are paired up. You will most likely need binoculars to see this.

You can’t miss it.\n\nMars is in the glare of the Sun at dusk.\n\nJupiter rises in the northeast around midnight and is quite bright.\n\nSaturn rises in the east as it gets dark. A great view in a telescope will help see as the rings cast a thin line across the planet.\n\nUranus is in the eastern sky after dark. You need a telescope to best observe the planet, although it is visible in binoculars.\n\nNeptune is in the east as it gets dark. You need a telescope to observe the planet.\n\nPluto is way out there in the solar system and requires taking images through a telescope spaced days apart to hunt it down.\n\n**DC-area events**\n\nInternational Observe the Moon Night has several events around the D.C. region.\n\n**Shenandoah National Park**\n\nShenandoah National Park’s Big Meadows is an excellent dark sky site and there are a variety of activities for you to enjoy throughout the Park.

            "snippet": "## Meteor Showers in Early and Late October\n\n### The Draconids – Dragon Meteors Under a Bright Moon\n\nThe\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaks around October 8, 2025, but this year the “Dragon” will have its fire stolen by moonlight. The Draconids are a minor shower (often only ~10 meteors per hour under dark skies [1]), and unfortunately a **full Moon on October 6–7** will flood the night sky with light during the peak [2]. The bright moonlight will wash out all but the brightest Draconid meteors, making them hard to spot. Best chance to catch a few “shooting stars” from Draco’s radiant (near the Dragon’s head in the northern sky) is *as soon as darkness falls* on October 8, before the Moon rises too high [3]. This unusual timing – evening instead of predawn – is because Draconid meteors fly in the early night hours (the shower’s radiant is highest in the sky at nightfall) [4].\n\nWhy bother with a faint shower? The Draconids are infamous for occasional\n\n**outbursts**. In rare years, if Earth passes through a dense clump of debris from the shower’s parent comet (21P/Giacobini-Zinner), the Draconids have surprised observers with hundreds or even thousands of meteors per hour (notably in 1933 and 1946) [5] [6]. Most years are quiet, but the comet did reach perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in March 2025, raising the *possibility* of enhanced activity [7] [8]. “Watch out if the Dragon awakes!” writes one skywatching columnist – that slim chance of a meteor storm keeps many enthusiasts outdoors **even in moonlight** during this shower [9]. While a storm is not expected, keep an eye on the northern sky on October 8–9 just in case. (The Draconids favor observers in the **Northern Hemisphere**; those far south won’t see much, as Draco sits low or below the horizon.)... ## Planetary Highlights and Conjunctions\n\nOctober 2025 offers plenty of planet spotting opportunities. Two bright planets,... **at peak brilliance**in these weeks – astronomers rate it around magnitude –4.5, the brightest it gets all year [48] [49]. **Tip:**after observing Venus and the Moon, scan higher up for fainter **Mars**(see below) and toward the west for Jupiter setting at dawn. **Mercury and Mars at Dusk:**Fleet-footed **Mercury**makes a challenging appearance in late October. On **October 29**, Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation, 23° away from the Sun in the evening sky [50]. This is actually Mercury’s *last*evening apparition of 2025, but it’s not particularly favorable for those in the Northern Hemisphere. Even at maximum separation, Mercury will be low in the bright twilight (it sets shortly after the Sun). Still, around the final week of October, persistent observers might catch Mercury as a faint “star” very low on the **west-southwest horizon**about 30–45 minutes after sunset [51]. Binoculars will help you spot it in the glow. (Observers in the Southern Hemisphere get a slightly better viewing angle, so Mercury will be a bit higher for them.) Intriguingly, **Mars**is also lurking in the same area of sky. Mars, now on the far side of the Sun and very faint, has been sinking into the sunset glare each evening. Around **October 19–23**, Mercury and Mars actually pass each other in what would be a *conjunction*– but this happens so deep in twilight that it’s a tough observation. Mercury is emerging upward from solar conjunction while Mars is vanishing downward into it, so they are both extremely low after sunset [52]. High Point Scientific notes this pairing gives a brief opportunity to see the two planets close together as they trade places relative to the Sun [53]. If you have a **very clear view of the western horizon**on Oct. 19–20, you might attempt a sighting: about 15–20 minutes after sunset, scan for Mercury (the brighter of the two) and see if you can also glimpse dim Mars nearby. Realistically, Mars will likely be invisible without a telescope. By early November, Mars is in conjunction with the Sun and gone. So think of this as **Mercury’s farewell to Mars**in the twilight – a symbolic handoff from one planet to the other.... ## Comets and Cosmic Visitors\n\nComet enthusiasts have much to be excited about in late 2025. October brings the potential for... *(Comet source refs: StarWalk/Starry Night guides [88] [89] [90]; NASA Science [91] [92]; Chron/EarthSky for context [93].)*... ## Auroras on the Rise – Eyes North (or South)!\n\nHigh-latitude skywatchers should stay alert this October for\n\n**aurora borealis** (Northern Lights) or aurora australis (Southern Lights). Solar activity is near its 11-year peak in 2025 – in fact, the Sun’s **solar maximum** is predicted for around July 2025 [94]. That means the Sun is freckled with sunspots and prone to eruptions like flares and coronal mass ejections, which send charged particles hurtling toward Earth. When those particles strike our atmosphere, they trigger the glowing curtains of auroras. The past year has already seen an uptick in auroral displays, and experts say 2025 will continue the trend [95] [96]. *“Aurora activity can often peak after solar maximum, meaning that the next couple of years will likely be an exciting time for aurora watchers,”* notes Dr. Renate Mauland-Hus, an astrophysicist interviewed by TimeandDate [97].\n\nOctober (along with the spring) is traditionally an excellent season for auroras because of the\n\n**equinox effect** – for reasons still being studied, geomagnetic disturbances seem to be more frequent around the equinoxes. With the **nights growing longer** in October, any geomagnetic storm has more hours of darkness to be observed. In practical terms, this means if the Sun belches out a strong Earth-directed solar flare or CME in September/October, auroras could potentially be visible farther from the poles than usual. Already in late 2024 and early 2025, auroras have been sighted at unusually low latitudes during big solar storms [98]. So if you live in **northern Europe, Canada, the northern U.S.** or similarly high latitudes (or the far southern hemisphere equivalents), keep an eye on space weather alerts. A good resource is NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center aurora forecasts or local observatory announcements.... While not a scheduled “event” like an eclipse, an auroral outbreak can be one of the most awe-inspiring skywatching experiences. Imagine curtains of green and purple light dancing on the horizon or overhead – it’s worth braving a cold night if an alert goes out. Even weaker geomagnetic activity can produce a diffuse green glow low in the north. City dwellers might not see much, but under dark rural skies the aurora can be stunning.\n\n**Bottom line:** 2025 is shaping up to be a top-notch aurora year, and **October’s aurora outlook is promising** due to the active Sun. As one astronomy site put it, *“With the Sun at solar maximum, 2025 promises more chances to witness incredible displays of the northern and southern lights.”* [99] So, if you’re in the auroral zone, be ready to “look up” on short notice when the solar wind delivers a geomagnetic surprise.\n\n*(Aurora source refs: TimeandDate [100], NOAA forecasts, Space.com solar cycle outlook [101].)*\n\n**Further Resources:** For more detailed guidance on these events, check out NASA’s monthly *“What’s Up”* skywatching video series [102], which often covers planetary positions and moon phases. Astronomy and space news sites like **Space.com** and **EarthSky** provide up-to-date observing tips and charts for meteor showers and conjunctions. Many national observatories (e.g., the **Royal Observatory Greenwich** or **U.S. Naval Observatory**) post monthly sky highlights on their websites, tailored to different regions. And if you plan to photograph the sky, don’t forget to consult aurora alerts or meteor shower live streams (the Virtual Telescope Project, for example, often hosts live feeds of celestial events [103]).... With a little planning, October 2025 could be an unforgettable month of skywatching. From the eerie\n\n**Draconid meteors**under an autumn sky, to the crisp mornings with **Venus and the crescent Moon**, to the spectacle of a **Harvest supermoon**, there’s a bounty of cosmic wonders to enjoy. So bundle up, find a dark sky if you can, and **enjoy the show** – the universe is putting on one nightly above us.

            "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## Filmography\n|Year|Title|Role|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|2018|*Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*|Herself|Contestant; winner|\n|2019|*Mani*|Jade|Main role (season 4)|\n|2020|*The Drew Barrymore Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Tom Green, Tabitha Brown\"|\n|2020|*Polly Pocket*|Herself (voice)|2 episodes|\n|2021|*Attaway General*|Jade|Episode: \"Difference Of Opinion\"|\n|2022|*The Tiny Chef Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Snap Pea Stir Fry\"|\n|2022|*Hell's Kitchen: Battle of the Ages*|Herself|Episode: \"Clawing Their Way to the Top\"|\n|2025|*Sneaks*|Sky (voice)| |\n\n## See also\n- Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n## References",

It’s an attitude shared by a generation that, in a shift from ones past, views sport as a form of play rather than competition.\n\nFor Sky and her skate friends, the thrill of getting better is part of the appeal.\n\n**“**We all want to do our best. We want to push the level of sports and break boundaries. And we all want to have a lot of fun,” says Sky.\n\n### “We all want to do our best. We want to push the level of sports and break boundaries. And we all want to have a lot of fun.”\n\n– Sky Brown\n\nWhen asked how she and her friends are different from past generations of skaters, Sky says, “We have a lot of energy to skate for hours and hours. And when we finish skating, we don’t chill. We just play something else.”\n\nWhether it’s dancing or skating or surfing, Sky knows no limits, and she’s taking her generation to the top with her. “I love to prove people wrong and show that age or size just does not matter for skateboarders,” she says. “I want to show the world that if you believe in yourself and just go for it, you can do anything.”\n\n### “We have a lot of energy to skate for hours and hours. And when we finish skating, we don’t chill. We just play something else.”\n\n– Sky Brown\n\n### “I want to show the world that if you believe in yourself and just go for it, you can do anything.”\n\n– Sky Brown\n\n",

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... 's nearest neighbor, the moon. We start off the month of October finding out that\n{ts:137} the moon is moving on from its waxing phase to a beautiful full phase on Monday, October the 6th. Now, many of\n{ts:146} you have heard of a harvest moon. And what is a harvest moon? It's the full moon that lies closest to the date of\n{ts:153} the autumnal equinox or the beginning of fall. Fall began, as many of you might know, back on September the 21st. So,\n{ts:162} the closest full moon to it would wind up being in early October. So, that date happens to be on the 6th at 11:48 p.m.\n{ts:172} Eastern Daylight Time. So, a quick history of the harvest moon. Why is it called that? In days when we were much\n{ts:179} more of an agricultural society and with crop you know crops being at the plentiful time for harvesting\n{ts:187} the light of the moon the full moon would help farmers to harvest crops. But astronomically this particular full moon\n{ts:194} the harvest moon rises very short shortly that is after sunset. So simple English we find out that this moon would... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

            "snippet": "# From streets to stadiums: Sky Brown, the youngest Olympic Medallist\n\nEmmy Schouten\n\nSky Brown (16) is one of the most talented skateboarders at this years Olympics. After her bronze medal in Tokyo, Sky is hungry for more. We’ll show you her journey to the Paris Olympics!\n\nMulti-talented\n\nSky Brown is half-British half-Japanese! Born in Miyazaki, her original name is Sukai Buraun (スカイ). Her dad Stuart is British, making here eligible to represent the UK on the Olympics. But he moved to the US before she was born. Sky spends half the year in Japan and the other half in the United States for school. She knows how to keep herself busy. If she’s not skateboarding, you can find her surfing, following guitar lessons or doing some jiu jitsu. Especially surfing is one of her big talents. Her original plan was to compete in\n\n*both* skateboarding and surfing at the Paris Olympics. She failed to qualify at the World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico. Despite not hitting her goal, everybody is super proud. And she’ll definitely try again for the 2028 Olympics ;). Her skateboarding career is the most successful yet. Sky started out with some YouTube tutorials and never had a coach. You can find her practicing in Huntington Beach LA. Sometimes she is joined by 3-time gold snowboarding medallist Shaun White who lives just around the corner.... Fun fact: Did you know that know that Sky won\n\n*Dancing with The Stars; Juniors* in 2018? Prizes\n\nAt just 9-years old, Sky participated in the Vans US Open. The youngest ever to do so! One year later, she became a professional skateboarder, again the youngest ever to do so ;). After her professional debut the prizes started coming. Sky won bronze and gold on the World Championships, two gold medals on the X Games, and silver and gold on the Dew Tour. But her best achievement was at the Tokyo Olympics. It was the year skateboarding debuted on the Olympics. Sky immediately took home bronze. At 13 years old, this made her the youngest UK Olympic medallist ever.\n\nA big inspiration\n\nHer skateboarding achievements inspire girls all over the globe. She became an instant role model. With partnerships from Nike, shoe and skate collaborations, Sky created her own brand. People come up to her wearing her helmet or using her skateboard. It pushes her to be the best version of herself everyday. Her message is clear: don’t care what people think. Everybody just has one life and you can’t let anybody stop you from what you want to do. It is her dream to inspire girls. Not even just in skateboarding, but whatever they want to do. This “Sky Brown-effect” is huge in the UK. In the last 5 years, skateboarding in London grew with 800%! A major part of this is girls hitting the streets after Sky’s Olympic performance.... No pressure\n\nEven with all eyes on her, Sky feels no pressure. Skateboarding is all about fun for her. She never sees it as practicing, it is her happy-place. Skating is her “playground”, and this year La Concorde in Paris will be hers. See her in action on August 6!",

My mind when I skate is just about having fun and showing my best.\n\n\"I like to skate beautifully and hopefully I can do that and show my dance routine.\"... ### Ad content | Stream Sky Sports on NOW\n\n**Stream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

            "snippet": "# Welcome To The ‘Top Chef’ of Surfboard Shaping\n\nEight men face off at the 2025 Boardroom Show — Eric Arakawa deems Dan Mann victorious.\n\n**Ideas are fleeting, but carrying them out requires perseverance, stones and sheer bloody-mindedness.**\n\nOne fruit of such labour is The Boardroom Show, an annual celebration of surfboards and their shapers that’s just completed its 24th edition at the Del Mar, CA, Fairgrounds.\n\n“The idea came from the Clark Foam closure in ’05,” says Boardroom Show’s founder Scott Bass. “There was a lot of shapers that I looked up to who didn’t have anywhere to put their wares.’\n\n“Retailers were filling their brick and mortars with overseas stuff—which I don’t blame them for—but in the meantime, the local shaper was getting left out. These guys are crucial to our culture, so I thought we had to do something to showcase them. That’s kind of the nexus of the whole deal.”\n\nScott had a dream: a festival of the surfboard that showcased the best of what the world’s rich array of board builders big-and-small had to offer.\n\nClearly, someone had to pay for this thing, so Scott put down his own capital, then decided to start at the top and work his way down. The results were instant and encouraging.... “I called Rusty (Preisendorfer) that first year and said, ‘Rusty, if I do this, will you get a booth?’” Scott explains. “He was like, ‘Yeah you can count on me.’ And then I called Matt Biolos and said, ‘Matt, if I do this, will you get a booth?’ And Matt said, ‘Yes.’ So I had two of the stalwarts of the surfboard industry agree to do it, then it just sort of took off from there.”\n\nWhat’s materialised from that point is far more nuanced than a room full of stacked racks. Clearly a creative romantic, Scott’s baby has morphed into a blend of competition, trade show and celebration, with themes galore. The brand booth set-up is pretty self-explanatory, featuring surfboards, hardware, all things surf — but the competition side is where things really get interesting.\n\nEvery year The Boardroom Show honours a shaper (in the past they’ve had Al Merrick, Simon Anderson, MR, John Bradbury, to name but a few) in their ‘Icons of Foam Shape-Off’ — a competition where board-builders chosen by the iconic shaper have to recreate some of\n\n*their* classic designs, all by hand, under a time limit, for a shot at the crown.... This year is was the legendary Hawaiian shaper Eric Arakawa, and the shapers he chose to recreate his designs were Dan Mann, Todd Proctor, Adam Warden, Chris Christenson, Richie Collins, Barry Van der Meulen Rodolfo Klima, and Allen White, who qualified for winning the shape-off element of the Surf Expo on the east coast.\n\nThe boards in question featured, “A Derek Ho tri-fin from his ’93 World Title winning campaign, a Waimea Bay gun he made for Ronnie Burns in ’86, then the Andy Irons board that he won the Pipe Masters and the World Title on in 2003.” Scott explains. “It’s strictly timed — they get to look at and measure the original board, then their hour and a half starts. Two shapers at a time, side by side like man-on-man heat.”\n\nEric Arakawa then judged the winner, and interestingly it was Dan Mann, who took down Allen White the wildcard in the final.\n\nApart from the ‘Icons of Foam’ there were all sorts of interesting components to The Boardroom Show, like a VIP dinner where eight paying customers got to hang and fine-dine with Eric and guests, and another, more low key shape-off that Scott describes as “The... *British Bake Off* of surfboards.”\n\n“It’s called the ‘Best in Show’ competition, it’s open to any board builder around the world. It’s free, and the public vote on the winner,” Scott says. “All you got to do is build a board and bring it to the show.”\n\nAs with everything Boardroom Show, there’s a theme (this is the\n\n*Bake-Off* Part), and this year Scott told competitors to, “Go make us a fish, but I want you to add wooden accents to the board and include meaningful symbology — maybe it’s your grandfather’s purple heart or your daughter’s astrological sign…”\n\nThe ‘Best in Show’ in 2025 was won by Steve Farwell of Farwell Surboards from Newport Beach, CA, who’ll receive a free booth at the next Boardroom Show for his troubles.\n\nBasically if you nerd-out on high-end surfboards (aka you surf at all), be sure to try get to the 25th instalment of the Boardroom Show.\n\nApart from supporting craftsmen big and small, you’ll be vindicating an idea, which is always a worthwhile pursuit in our books.\n\n*Give them a follow on IG for all Boardroom Show updates.*\n\n**For the three people on whom our sarcasm is lost: Gerry Lopez and Eric Arakawa. *... ## Most Recent\n\n## Welcome To The ‘Top Chef’ of Surfboard Shaping\n\nEight men face off at the 2025 Boardroom Show — Eric Arakawa deems Dan Mann…\n\n## Watch: ‘Feels Like Yesterday’ Starring The Colapinto Bros, Cole Houshmand & San Clemente’s Electric Youth\n\nA Film of the Year contender by Jacob Vanderwork.\n\n## Shane Borland Crowned World’s Best Surf/Skate Crossbreed At Keris Cup\n\n+ Sky Brown dislocates her shoulder, still packs proper Padang tube.\n\n## America’s Greatest East Coast Surf Town Is Disappearing\n\nA story of Atlantic storms, Cold War ghosts and institutional negligence.\n\n## “We Sat On These Concrete Expansion Joints Right Under The Air Section — But For Rasta Robb We Needed A New Marker”\n\nBill Morris + Ryan Heywood tell the story behind 19 unseen frames from the Stab…\n\n## Watch: Craig Anderson in ‘Samudra Spirit Glitters’\n\n\"I feel people can smell the process.

Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices (https://megaphone.fm/adchoices)... [Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:385} your shadow by the brilliance of Venus. Now, you may wonder, how could that be? Well, if you're in a snowy field because\n{ts:390} of the whiteness of snow and Venus was, of course, you're staring at it and you turned around under super dark\n{ts:397} conditions, you might get to see your shadow, not just like the moon would cast your shadow or the sun in the\n{ts:403} daytime, but the planet Venus itself, which is quite interesting. So, ladies and gentlemen, a good opportunity now to\n{ts:410} talk about a pair of binoculars. Now, I get this question on the Dr. I experience all the time. And you can\n{ts:415} email me with your questions at just drsky at wabcradio.com.\n{ts:421} I'm there for you to answer questions and no question is foolish. I mean, we get questions and help people out.\n{ts:426} That's what we do to explore the mysteries of the universe. So, a pair of binoculars, let's talk about it for a\n{ts:433} moment. You use both eyes. Hopefully, your eyes are in good health. And even if they... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

            "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## External links\n- Sky Brown at Olympics.com\n- Sky Brown at The Boardr\n- Sky Brown at SPoT\n- Sky Brown at IMDb\n\nCategories: - 2008 births\n- Living people\n- Japanese female skateboarders\n- Japanese skateboarders\n- British skateboarders\n- Japanese people of British descent\n- British people of Japanese descent\n- Japanese expatriates in the United States\n- British expatriate sportspeople in the United States\n- Skateboarders at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n- Olympic skateboarders for Great Britain\n- Olympic medalists in skateboarding\n- Medalists at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n- Medalists at the 2024 Summer Olympics\n- Olympic bronze medallists for Great Britain\n- X Games competitors\n- Sportspeople from Miyazaki (city)\n- World Skateboarding Championship medalists\n- British children\n- Japanese children\n- Skateboarders at the 2024 Summer Olympics\n- 21st-century Japanese sportswomen\n- Child sportspeople",

've all booked rooms in the city, all the interstate visitors. They're spending money at restaurants. the investment uh from Hong Kong, the investment on the Hong Kong tote went to 99.5 million Hong Kong dollars, which surpassed the previous record of 84\n{ts:323} million Hong Kong dollars, which was invested on the Saudi Cup. Now, the Saudi Cup was important because that's the race that rodic Warrior, of course. So, this went beyond that. Incredible. Here's the race. Darren Flynnel's call of the 2025 20 million Tab Everest\n{ts:341} and we're just about ready to run to the roar of a youthful crowd and they're off in the tab Everest. An overpass begin fast as expected. Caying risings right there and now Mazu is whipping up underneath the pair. Lady Shannondal has got a great spot fourth in front of\n{ts:359} Tempted. Further back to Jolly Star. They're followed then by Jimmy Star is going forward from the wide drawer. Brias's got back in the field followed then by Angel Capital. Jedial and Magic Time. Mazu shows the way. Overpass sits on the outside. Caryang rising two\n{ts:376} lengths away. Third is trucking along and Jimmy keeps him company. Jimmy Star up on the outside followed by Tempted. Lady Shannondoa and Jolly Star gets great cover turning for home. Marzu in front from over pass. Caying rising two lengths away. Then Jimmy Star clear from... $150 with any confidence whatsoever, even though he got to even money. So, in the space between October\n{ts:498} 7 and October 18, David Hayes has elevated that horse, not even back to his best, but back to a a point where he can do this. Yeah, he's just incredible. Um he and he and I wasn't at the trial, but I the vision I\n{ts:515} saw of him at the trial walking around, he was hot, he was bothered. Uh he's just And you know, everyone tells me that he's never trled bad in Hong Kong. So, it was it was a one-off that really well, it even I think it's even scared Zack. He said, \"Well, there's room for improvement.\" I'm sure I'm I'm sure of\n{ts:534} that. Well, you could tell Ronnie, like I said in that interview on Friday that I done with Zach, like he was concerned like and not only about the horse, but about the track conditions as well. Like they were obviously a bit worried and the surface, all the little things that I said, \"Oh, does it bother you?\" He said, \"Yes, it does.\"\n{ts:550} normally Zach would go the other way, you know, and he... {ts:904} line I got to give it to Brown Ethan Brown as well he had a crack at given given it to Zach there but he just wasn't fast enough on the right horse let's talk about David Hayes and um the way he has embraced this journey for everyone uh even when He said, \"I want to take\n{ts:923} Kaying Rising away from the crowd to saddle him up because I think that's what we need to do to have him right.\" He also said, \"But I still want to show him off to the crowd. I still want him to parade. I want everyone to have a look at him and then we'll move him out the back and then we'll saddle him up.\" After he\n{ts:940} settled up, he came back out into that pre- parade and we got another look at him.... {ts:1347} I was I was very happy to see him sit down with you on the Friday. you did a long interview with him which we played on the morning of the Everest and how relaxed he was and how open he was to to still talk about something that he's been talking about for weeks and weeks and weeks. Uh surely he was looking forward to the talk being over and just getting out\n{ts:1364} there and doing it. But he sat down, he was relaxed and he gave you that interview to talk about what he thought of the day coming up tomorrow. Yeah. And like I said, Rads, like with all that pressure, not just all the money and you know, like, but that big buildup, like I said, it's it's a lot of pressure and that\n{ts:1383} those BS like Zack and Huey and even Lukie Nolan for that matter, you know, like to handle that pressure, I'm not even sure I'd be able to do it. You know what I mean? Like he could quite often panic. Like even though he's a front running horse, when he jumped, he jumped well. Obviously overpass outside Mazu underneath him. You watch the overhead shot and he just gives it... 's coming back to scale now. Will you be back? Will you be back next year? Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Don't you worry about that. And we'll get that Twitter guy out of my life and it'll be\n{ts:1627} good fun. Good on you, David. Oh, that Twitter guy. Now, that was the fake news moment. That was the fake news moment. Oh, yeah, baby. He's coming back. So, actually before we move on, have you got the tab Everest market? Let's have the first ladies and gentlemen, here it is. The first market\n{ts:1646} we're going to show you for next year's Everest. I don't keep count how many times we show you this between now and October, whatever, next year. They put up 250 yesterday. They put up 250. Oh, no. He's into 225 already. No. Well, they get their money back if he doesn't come.\n{ts:1666} Back. I think he's coming. Bay Jimmy Jolie. Well, we're just rehashing the the beaten brigade that the two incoming a Bay and Autumn Glow. We'll see what happens. They don't think Tempted went any good yesterday. Well, she... s done 60 interviews this week of probably which 45 or 50 of them were over that\n{ts:1946} conjecture. So, you know, we thought it was funny at first, like, oh, how stupid. And then when it sort of uh took hold and everyone was ringing us from stewards to, you know, the CEO of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, it was just like, guys, this is just a, you know, this is\n{ts:1964} just a hack. So, anyway, you David said a couple of days ago and he said, I thought I'd seen everything in racing. I haven't. So we uh I arrived last Saturday at Rose Hill Gardens and Ronnie said to me, \"This horse is on the first plane back to Hong Kong if these reports are right.\n{ts:1982} It started I mean it really heated up on Sunday but it was talked it was happened on Friday night.\" Yeah, it was going Friday afternoon into the night from all sorts of sources. So it spread like a bush fire and you know what it likes with rumors, they get bigger and bigger and bigger and someone puts their own top spin on it and they've got him, you know, in... 's just playing unbelievably well. You know, maybe the fence wasn't the place to be yesterday if you want to nitpick, but that's that's no problem whatsoever. It's a big track. It's probably better really. It makes them fan and carry on. A few Well, but I don't think we had a leader win all day.\n{ts:2201} Yeah. Uh so hard to lead and win. And Rody, it it makes it even better the job that Michael Wood and Dave Anderson have done with the track because they haven't had the rain. They've had to water it. Yeah. Yeah. And they and and sometimes that can be dangerous and they've got the watering right.\n{ts:2218} That's what I reckon. And then Tim walks the tracks. I listen to Tim. He's a very He's got all the figures. Tim Ryan. Yep. And he says and I agree that they have just the they've got the watering down pat. They're not watering tracks down to start off on soft fives. They you can\n{ts:2235} get so much wrong doing that. Yes. They just put enough in there slowly slowly. I know they've had the weather and we've had rain at the right time of the week all mostly. Mostly yes. But it worked out perfect there on the weekend. Like I was talking to Michael Wood like they considering putting one... 's definitely a PB. Even though he's, you know, in the in the book, he's finished fourth, but that he just run out of his skin there on Saturday. So, as it turned out, it wasn't a bad trial. It was a good trial for everything. It was a nice trial.\n{ts:2392} Well, offline car Ying Mr. Bright Side just got nutted out. It's been a great try. Well, the quote from John O'",

            "snippet": "- Details\n\n- By Native News Online Staff\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON — In addition to articles already covered by Native News Online, here is a roundup of other news released from Washington, D.C. that impacts Indian Country recently. With no concrete discussions underway between congreesional Republicans and Democrats, the federal government shutdown will enter its fourth week on Wednesday with no end in sight.\n\n##### NCAI Strongly Condemns Large-Scale Federal Layoffs Harming Tribal Programs\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) strongly condemns the large-scale reductions in force (RIFs) purportedly resulting from the ongoing government shutdown, which disproportionately impact Tribal programs — particularly those supporting health care, housing, economic development, and education in Native communities.\n\n**Never miss Indian Country’s biggest stories and breaking news.**Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\n\n\"Targeting people who manage and support programs that are the backbone of Tribal communities — our health, our homes, our economic futures, and our children's education — is not just short-sighted, it's an abdication of the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations,\" said NCAI Executive Director Larry Wright, Jr. \"Our communities are not expendable. These actions are a betrayal of the promises made to Tribal Nations, and we will not remain silent as the very infrastructure of our future is dismantled.\"\n\n###### CMS Hosts All Tribes Webinar on the Rural Health Transformation Program\n\nLast week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) hosted an All Tribes Webinar on the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). The RHTP was authorized by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and will invest $50 billion into improving rural health care over the next five years.\n\nThe National Indian Health Board (NIHB) hosted a Tribal caucus to help Tribal leaders, health experts, Tribal organizations, and health professionals prepare for the webinar. During the Tribal caucus, NIHB provided an overview of the RHTP and analyzed its Tribal impacts. You can find the caucus presentation slides here.\n\nTo follow up after the webinar, CMS Division of Tribal Affairs (DTA) circulated the presentation slides.... ##### Medicare Open Enrollment is Underway\n\nMedicare Open Enrollment runs from October 15 through December 7. During this period, beneficiaries can review and make changes to their Medicare coverage for 2026, including switching plans or updating prescription drug coverage. Although under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), special enrollment periods have been changed, members of federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Corporation shareholder can still enroll year-round. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to compare options and ensure their plan meets their current health needs. The changes made during Open Enrollment are effective January 1 of next year. Read about your options and find more information here.\n\n##### Federal Government Goes Paperless for Payments\n\nStarting Sept. 30, the federal government went paperless, which means most federal payments that were made by paper check—including Social Security benefits and tax refunds—will be made electronically.\n\nThe change came as a result of Executive Order (EO) 14247 “Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account” that was signed on March 25, 2024 by President Trump.\n\nIn order to promote public awareness of the Federal Government’s shift to secure electronic payments, the Department of the Treasury has created a new resource page related to EO 14247 at MyMoney.gov/FederalPayments.\n\nThe new page features frequently asked questions about the EO, directions for signing up for electronic payments, and Federal agency contact information where payment recipients can learn more or get help.... #### More Stories Like ThisNative News Weekly (August 25, 2024): D.C. Briefs\n\nUS Presidents in Their Own Words Concerning American Indians\n\nOral History Project Announces 14th Stop in Portland, Oregon: NABS Continues to Gather Crucial Stories Across Indian Country\n\nCheyenne River Youth Project Kicks Off Annual Family Services Membership Drive\n\n**Help us tell the stories that could save Native languages and food traditions**\n\nAt a critical moment for Indian Country, Native News Online is embarking on our most ambitious reporting project yet: \"Cultivating Culture,\" a three-year investigation into two forces shaping Native community survival—food sovereignty and language revitalization.\n\nThe devastating impact of COVID-19 accelerated the loss of Native elders and with them, irreplaceable cultural knowledge. Yet across tribal communities, innovative leaders are fighting back, reclaiming traditional food systems and breathing new life into Native languages. These aren't just cultural preservation efforts—they're powerful pathways to community health, healing, and resilience.\n\nOur dedicated reporting team will spend three years documenting these stories through on-the-ground reporting in 18 tribal communities, producing over 200 in-depth stories, 18 podcast episodes, and multimedia content that amplifies Indigenous voices. We'll show policymakers, funders, and allies how cultural restoration directly impacts physical and mental wellness while celebrating successful models of sovereignty and self-determination.\n\nThis isn't corporate media parachuting into Indian Country for a quick story. This is sustained, relationship-based journalism by Native reporters who understand these communities. It's \"Warrior Journalism\"—fearless reporting that serves the 5.5 million readers who depend on us for news that mainstream media often ignores.\n\n**We need your help right now.** While we've secured partial funding, we're still $450,000 short of our three-year budget. Our immediate goal is $25,000 this month to keep this critical work moving forward—funding reporter salaries, travel to remote communities, photography, and the deep reporting these stories deserve.\n\nEvery dollar directly supports Indigenous journalists telling Indigenous stories. Whether it's $5 or $50, your contribution ensures these vital narratives of resilience, innovation, and hope don't disappear into silence.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. Native languages are being lost at an alarming rate. Food insecurity plagues many tribal communities. But solutions are emerging, and these stories need to be told.\n\n*Support independent Native journalism. Fund the stories that matter.*\n\nLevi Rickert (Potawatomi), Editor & Publisher",

                "snippet": "### National Summary\n\n#### Overall Economic Activity\n\nEconomic activity changed little on balance since the previous report, with three Districts reporting slight to modest growth in activity, five reporting no change, and four noting a slight softening. Overall consumer spending, particularly on retail goods, inched down in recent weeks, although auto sales were boosted in some Districts by strong demand for electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit at the end of September. Demand for leisure and hospitality services by international travelers fell further over the reporting period, while demand by domestic consumers was largely unchanged. Nevertheless, spending by higher-income individuals on luxury travel and accommodation was reportedly strong. Several reports highlighted that lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. Manufacturing activity varied by District, and most reports noted challenging conditions due to higher tariffs and waning overall demand. Activity in agriculture, energy, and transportation was generally down among reporting Districts. Conditions in the financial services sector and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, were mixed; some reports noted improved business lending in recent weeks due to lower interest rates, while other reports continued to highlight muted activity. The outlook for future economic growth varied by District and sector. Sentiment reportedly improved in a few Districts, with some contacts expecting an uptick in demand over the next 6 to 12 months. However, many others continued to expect elevated uncertainty to weigh down activity. One District report highlighted the downside risk to growth from a prolonged government shutdown.... #### Labor Markets\n\nEmployment levels were largely stable in recent weeks, and demand for labor was generally muted across Districts and sectors. In most Districts, more employers reported lowering head counts through layoffs and attrition, with contacts citing weaker demand, elevated economic uncertainty, and, in some cases, increased investment in artificial intelligence technologies. Employers that reported hiring generally noted improved labor availability, and some favored hiring temporary and part-time workers over offering full-time employment opportunities. Nevertheless, labor supply in the hospitality, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing sectors was reportedly strained in several Districts due to recent changes to immigration policies. Wages grew across all reporting Districts, generally at a modest to moderate pace, and labor cost pressures intensified in recent weeks due to outsized increases in employer-sponsored health insurance expenses.\n\n#### Prices\n\nPrices rose further during the reporting period. Several District reports indicated that input costs increased at a faster pace due to higher import costs and the higher cost of services such as insurance, health care, and technology solutions. Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied. Some firms facing tariff-induced cost pressures kept their selling prices largely unchanged to preserve market share and in response to pushback from price-sensitive clients. However, there were also reports of firms in manufacturing and retail trades fully passing higher import costs along to their customers. Waning demand in some markets reportedly pushed prices down for some materials, such as steel in the Sixth District and lumber in the Twelfth District.... #### Highlights by Federal Reserve District\n\n##### Boston\n\nEconomic activity expanded slightly, with modest growth in consumer spending. Employment was flat, as both hiring and layoffs increased modestly. Prices increased at a moderate pace, although certain cost pressures intensified. Home sales were flat from a year earlier. The outlook was neutral to cautiously optimistic, but contacts saw mostly downside risks.\n\n##### New York\n\nEconomic activity continued to decline slightly. Employment held steady, and wage growth remained modest. The pace of price increases remained elevated but was little changed. Manufacturing activity held steady after a summer uptick. Consumer spending increased modestly, buoyed by mid- to upper-income households. Businesses did not expect activity to increase much in the months ahead.\n\n##### Philadelphia\n\nBusiness activity increased slightly in the current Beige Book period. Employment levels increased slightly, and wages again rose at modest pre-pandemic rates. Prices continued to rise moderately. Activity increased slightly for nonmanufacturers and moderately for manufacturers. Generally, firms expect modest growth over the next six months, but heightened economic uncertainty remains.\n\n##### Cleveland\n\nFourth District business activity was flat in recent weeks, but contacts expected activity to increase modestly in months ahead. Commercial construction and financial services contacts noted an uptick in demand because of lower interest rates. Contacts said that cost growth remained robust, while their selling prices increased modestly.... ##### Richmond\n\nThe regional economy grew modestly in recent weeks. Consumer spending continued to grow modestly and import activity rose. Manufacturing activity declined slightly and growth in the remaining industries was largely flat. Employment levels were largely unchanged and wage growth remained moderate. Price growth remained moderate, overall, despite some pickup in price growth in the manufacturing sector.\n\n##### Atlanta\n\nThe Sixth District economy was unchanged. Employment levels were steady, and wages grew modestly. Prices increased moderately. Consumer spending fell, and leisure travel softened. Home sales declined, and commercial real estate was unchanged. Transportation declined. Manufacturing grew slightly. Energy grew moderately, and agriculture was healthy.\n\n##### Chicago\n\nEconomic activity in the Seventh District was flat. Consumer spending increased modestly; construction and real estate activity increased slightly; employment was flat; nonbusiness contacts saw no change in activity; business spending declined slightly; and manufacturing activity declined modestly. Prices rose moderately, wages were up modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income were unchanged.\n\n##### St. Louis\n\nEconomic activity and employment levels have remained unchanged since our previous report. Contacts continue to report that immigration policies have been resulting in labor shortages. Prices have increased moderately, with contacts reporting that inflation is eroding consumer purchasing power. Banking activity has remained unchanged since our previous report, with overall credit conditions remaining strong. Agriculture conditions are strained and have further deteriorated. The outlook remains slightly pessimistic.... ##### Minneapolis\n\nDistrict economic activity contracted slightly. Labor demand softened, according to firms and job seekers, though wage growth remained moderate. Price increases remained modest, but input price pressures increased. Manufacturing and commercial real estate were flat, but most other sectors contracted. Agricultural contacts were concerned about China's elimination of soybean purchases.\n\n##### Kansas City\n\nEconomic activity in the Tenth District fell slightly over the past month. Employment levels declined slightly, and bankers noted consumer loan portfolios deteriorated moderately. Though activity fell recently, expectations for sales and employment in 2026 were broadly optimistic. Expectations for the pace of price growth in 2026 were similarly above 2025 levels.\n\n##### Dallas\n\nEconomic activity was flat. Service sector activity contracted mildly. Retail sales fell, while the pace of manufacturing output growth moderated. Loan demand grew, but the housing market remained weak, and drilling and well completion activity was flat. Employment dipped, and wage growth was modest. Price pressures were subdued in services but remained elevated in the manufacturing sector. Outlooks deteriorated with slowing demand, policy uncertainty, and inflation highlighted as the top concerns for businesses.\n\n##### San Francisco\n\nEconomic activity edged down slightly. Employment levels were little changed. Wages grew slightly, and prices rose modestly. Activity in retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate decreased somewhat while commercial real estate activity was unchanged. Manufacturing and lending activity remained stable. Conditions in consumer and business services were mixed.\n\nNote: This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on information collected on or before October 6, 2025.

                "snippet": "#### While the near-term forecast is revised up modestly, global growth remains subdued, as the newly introduced policies slowly come into focus\n\nThe global economy is adjusting to a landscape reshaped by new policy measures. Some extremes of higher tariffs were tempered, thanks to subsequent deals and resets. But the overall environment remains volatile, and temporary factors that supported activity in the first half of 2025—such as front-loading—are fading.\n\nAs a result, global growth projections in the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) are revised upward relative to the April 2025 WEO but continue to mark a downward revision relative to the pre-policy-shift forecasts. Global growth is projected to slow from 3.3 percent in 2024 to 3.2 percent in 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026, with advanced economies growing around 1.5 percent and emerging market and developing economies just above 4 percent. Inflation is projected to continue to decline globally, though with variation across countries: above target in the United States—with risks tilted to the upside—and subdued elsewhere.\n\nRisks are tilted to the downside. Prolonged uncertainty, more protectionism, and labor supply shocks could reduce growth. Fiscal vulnerabilities, potential financial market corrections, and erosion of institutions could threaten stability.\n\nPolicymakers are urged to restore confidence through credible, transparent, and sustainable policies. Trade diplomacy should be paired with macroeconomic adjustment. Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt. Central bank independence should be preserved. Efforts on structural reforms should be redoubled. As Chapter 2 shows, past actions to improve policy frameworks have served countries well. As Chapter 3 demonstrates, industrial policy may have a role, but full consideration should be given to opportunity costs and trade-offs involved in its use.... ###### Chapter 1: Global Prospects and Policies\n\nGlobal growth is projected to slow and growth prospects remain dim, as the world adjusts to a landscape marked by greater protectionism and fragmentation. Global headline inflation is expected to decline further but remain above target in some countries. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Prolonged uncertainty and escalation of protectionist measures may further hinder growth. Larger-than-expected shocks to labor supply could reduce growth, especially in economies facing aging populations and skill shortages. Fiscal vulnerabilities and financial market fragilities may interact with rising borrowing costs and increased rollover risks for sovereigns. An abrupt repricing of tech stocks could threaten macrofinancial stability. Pressure on the independence of key economic institutions could undermine sound economic decision making. To navigate a global economy in flux, policymakers should restore confidence through credible, transparent, and sustainable policies\n\n###### Chapter 2: Emerging Market Resilience: Good Luck or Good Policies?\n\nEmerging markets have shown remarkable resilience to risk-off shocks in recent years. While favorable external conditions—\n\n*good luck*—contributed to this resilience, improvements in policy frameworks— *good policies*—played a critical role in bolstering the capacity of emerging markets to withstand risk-off shocks. Improvements in monetary and fiscal policy implementation and credibility have reduced reliance on foreign exchange interventions, with central banks less sensitive to fiscal interference and holding sway over domestic borrowing conditions. Looking ahead, countries with robust frameworks face easier policy trade-offs and are better positioned to navigate risk-off episodes. In contrast, economies with weaker frameworks risk de-anchoring inflation expectations and larger output losses if monetary tightening is delayed, especially when persistent price pressures emerge. In these settings, costly foreign exchange interventions offer only temporary relief and are less necessary when policy frameworks are sound.... ###### Chapter 3: Industrial Policy: Managing Trade-Offs to Promote Growth and Resilience\n\nCountries are increasingly using industrial policy to reshape their economies by supporting strategic sectors and firms. Motivations include boosting productivity, reducing reliance on imports—especially in energy—and enhancing resilience. Industrial policies can help jump-start domestic industries, but their efficacy is sensitive to sector-specific characteristics that can be hard to determine in advance. And industrial policies present trade-offs. Onshoring production in a strategic sector might lead to higher consumer prices for a prolonged period. And the fiscal cost of industrial policy can be substantial at a time of elevated debt and constrained public finances. Even when sector-level outcomes are positive, industrial policy can generate negative cross-sector spillovers and reduce overall productivity by drawing resources inefficiently away from sectors that are not targeted. Effective industrial policy requires careful targeting and implementation, strong institutions, complementary structural reforms and sound macroeconomic policy.\n\n#### Publications\n\n\n\nJuly 2025\n\n- Global Imbalances in a Shifting World\n\n\n\nRegional Economic Outlooks\n\n- Latest Issues\n\n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\nFinance & Development\n\n- Stablecoins and the Future of Finance",

                "snippet": "[10] [11]. **Three Featured Comets.**October 2025 is unusually rich in cometary activity. Interstellar **Comet 3I/ATLAS**(discovered July 2025) will reach perihelion Oct 30, at about 1.4 AU from the Sun [12]. Recent analyses by astronomers (Avi Loeb and others) estimate its nucleus is **>3 miles wide**, with a mass of ~33 billion tons [13]. (Importantly, 3I/ATLAS stays far from Earth – closest approach ~1.8 AU – and will pass behind the Sun, reappearing in December [14] [15].) Two other comets, **SWAN (C/2025 R2)**and **Lemmon (C/2025 A6)**, will brighten in the sky. SWAN reaches its closest Earth approach (~0.26 AU) on Oct 19 but remains very dim without a telescope [16]. Comet **Lemmon**rounds closest to Earth (~0.60 AU) on Oct 21, and forecasts suggest it could brighten to ~magnitude +3 by perihelion on Nov 8. This implies naked-eye visibility under dark skies; Universe Magazine notes that around Oct 21 Lemmon “will be clearly visible even to the naked eye”... ## A Rare October Super Harvest Moon\n\nOctober’s full Moon (Oct 6 local dates) coincides with lunar perigee (closest approach), making it a\n\n**supermoon** – the largest of 2025 [28] [29]. It is also the **Harvest Moon**, by definition the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. However, in 2025 the timing is unusual: unlike most years when the Harvest Moon falls in September, this year it slips into October. *Space.com* explains that “the full moon of Oct. 6… will also carry the title ‘Harvest Moon’” because it actually lies closer to the Sept 23 equinox than September’s full moon [30]. According to *Space.com* expert Joe Rao, “October’s full moon will be the largest and brightest Moon of the year,” and the first supermoon since Nov 2024 [31]. This late Harvest Moon is the latest since 1987 [32].\n\nAstronomers emphasize that the visual effect is subtle: although the Moon will be ~6–14% larger and ~13–30% brighter than average\n\n[33] [34], most people see little actual size change. (The perceived “Moon illusion” makes it look even larger near the horizon [35] [36].) Still, the sight of a bright orange Moon high among the stars is a photogenic treat. Skywatchers in North America will see the Full Moon on the evening of Oct 6, with peak illumination at 11:48 p.m. EDT.... ## Meteor Showers: Draconids & Orionids\n\nOctober brings two named meteor showers, but the real highlight is the Orionids. The\n\n**Draconids** (from Comet 21P/Giacobini–Zinner) peak around Oct 8–9. Unfortunately, this coincides with the super-Harvest Moon, so apart from occasional very bright meteors the shower will largely be washed out by moonlight [37]. National Geographic notes that in 2025 “all but the brightest meteors will likely be drowned out by moonlight” for the Draconids [38]. Despite their low predicted rate (Zenithal Hourly Rate ~5) and the lunar interference, the Draconids are known for erratic outbursts in some years – so it’s still worth a quick look if skies are clear.\n\nThe\n\n**Orionid** meteor shower, by contrast, will be truly unmissable this year. The Orionids — debris from Halley’s Comet — are active Oct 2–Nov 12, but peak activity is expected the night of Oct 21–22 [39] [40]. Crucially, the new Moon on Oct 21 means almost no moonlight during the peak. Both EarthSky and the Planetary Society note that 2025 offers “ideal conditions” for the Orionids. According to the Planetary Society, the Orionids are normally a “medium-low strength shower producing up to 20 meteors per hour from a dark site,” and this year “moonlight will not interfere with observing” thanks to the new Moon [41]. EarthSky concurs: “in 2025, the Orionid meteor shower should rain down its greatest number of meteors on the morning of October 21. The moon won’t interfere.” [42]. Space.com’s Anthony Wood advises skywatchers to “look up on the nights between Oct. 2 to Nov. 12 to see tiny shards of Halley’s Comet strike Earth’s atmosphere” [43], especially around the peak. Under clear, dark skies at peak, observers can reasonably hope to count **10–20 Orionids per hour**, many leaving long glowing trails or occasional fireballs [44] [45]. The best viewing is after midnight, facing Orion’s radiant in the southeast, with patience and a reclining chair to scan the sky.... Meanwhile, two long-period comets discovered earlier in 2025 will be visible in binoculars or better.\n\n**Comet SWAN (C/2025 R2)** was found in SOHO images and passes perihelion Sept 2025. By mid-October it begins appearing in the western evening sky, reaching closest Earth approach (0.26 AU) on Oct 19. However, forecasts indicate SWAN will likely remain rather faint (around 6–7th magnitude), requiring telescopes for casual observers [54].\n\nThe comet most promising to backyard skywatchers is\n\n**C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)**. Discovered Jan 2025 by the Mount Lemmon Survey, it has been steadily brightening. In late September southern observers were already seeing it in binoculars. Lemmon comes closest on Oct 21 (about 0.60 AU from Earth). Current models predict it could reach a visual magnitude of roughly +3 by that time – bright enough to be “clearly visible even to the naked eye” under dark skies [55]. (By November 8, at perihelion, it might brighten further.) As Universe Magazine explains: *“According to current forecasts, [Lemmon’s] brightness at [Oct 21] will reach +3.1, which means it will be clearly visible even to the naked eye”* [56]. Comet Lemmon will move quickly across northern constellations, so charts or apps will help track it; by late October it may appear low in the northwest after sunset. But as comet expert David Levy reminds us, **“comets are like cats: they have tails, and they do precisely what they want.”** [57] Amateur astronomers will be watching closely to see if Lemmon lives up to predictions.... [64] – offering a great opportunity to spot M31 by eye or binoculars. Later in the month the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) climbs high (best around Oct 15) [65]. With the new moon on Oct 21 and crisp autumn air, late October is ideal for binoculars or small telescopes: skywatching guides note that “the nights of Oct 20/21” will be a great chance to combine meteor-hunting with searches for these galaxies and nebulae [66].\n\nFinally, the fall sky brings the familiar W-shape of Cassiopeia and the Perseids’ Double Cluster into early evening view. All October, darker skies and cooler weather mean sharper, steadier viewing. Skywatchers are advised to get away from city lights, dress warmly, and give their eyes time to adapt. As\n\n*Astro Photons* advises, use the new-moon window (Oct 20–23) for deep-sky hunting, but “enjoy the brighter planets and Orionids throughout the month” [67] [68].\n\nOctober 2025 promises a cornucopia of sky sights. Between the Harvest supermoon, dual meteor showers, and multiple comets, there’s plenty for both casual observers and seasoned astronomers to enjoy. The combined insights of professional skywatchers and astrophiles remind us to look up – there are guaranteed\n\n*“epic astronomical events”* to see [69] [70].\n\n**Sources:** National Geographic [71] [72]; Space.com [73] [74]; Planetary Society [75]; *Universum* magazine [76] [77]; EarthSky [78]; NASA science releases [79] [80]; ABC News [81] [82]; local astronomy reporting [83] [84].",

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... 's nearest neighbor, the moon. We start off the month of October finding out that\n{ts:137} the moon is moving on from its waxing phase to a beautiful full phase on Monday, October the 6th. Now, many of\n{ts:146} you have heard of a harvest moon. And what is a harvest moon? It's the full moon that lies closest to the date of\n{ts:153} the autumnal equinox or the beginning of fall. Fall began, as many of you might know, back on September the 21st. So,\n{ts:162} the closest full moon to it would wind up being in early October. So, that date happens to be on the 6th at 11:48 p.m.\n{ts:172} Eastern Daylight Time. So, a quick history of the harvest moon. Why is it called that? In days when we were much\n{ts:179} more of an agricultural society and with crop you know crops being at the plentiful time for harvesting\n{ts:187} the light of the moon the full moon would help farmers to harvest crops. But astronomically this particular full moon\n{ts:194} the harvest moon rises very short shortly that is after sunset. So simple English we find out that this moon would... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... 's nearest neighbor, the moon. We start off the month of October finding out that\n{ts:137} the moon is moving on from its waxing phase to a beautiful full phase on Monday, October the 6th. Now, many of\n{ts:146} you have heard of a harvest moon. And what is a harvest moon? It's the full moon that lies closest to the date of\n{ts:153} the autumnal equinox or the beginning of fall. Fall began, as many of you might know, back on September the 21st. So,\n{ts:162} the closest full moon to it would wind up being in early October. So, that date happens to be on the 6th at 11:48 p.m.\n{ts:172} Eastern Daylight Time. So, a quick history of the harvest moon. Why is it called that? In days when we were much\n{ts:179} more of an agricultural society and with crop you know crops being at the plentiful time for harvesting\n{ts:187} the light of the moon the full moon would help farmers to harvest crops. But astronomically this particular full moon\n{ts:194} the harvest moon rises very short shortly that is after sunset. So simple English we find out that this moon would... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

                "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## Filmography\n|Year|Title|Role|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|2018|*Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*|Herself|Contestant; winner|\n|2019|*Mani*|Jade|Main role (season 4)|\n|2020|*The Drew Barrymore Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Tom Green, Tabitha Brown\"|\n|2020|*Polly Pocket*|Herself (voice)|2 episodes|\n|2021|*Attaway General*|Jade|Episode: \"Difference Of Opinion\"|\n|2022|*The Tiny Chef Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Snap Pea Stir Fry\"|\n|2022|*Hell's Kitchen: Battle of the Ages*|Herself|Episode: \"Clawing Their Way to the Top\"|\n|2025|*Sneaks*|Sky (voice)| |\n\n## See also\n- Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n## References",

Sky head coach, Tyler Marsh, told the press that he and his team did not report or witness any misconduct while at Gainbridge Fieldhouse and only learned about the allegations after the game had concluded. Nine days later, the WNBA announced their investigation was complete, and all allegations of racist fan behavior were unsubstantiated.\n\nOn June 8, 2025, it was announced that newly signed guard, Courtney Vandersloot, sustained a right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear during the June 7 game against the Indiana Fever and would miss the rest of the season.\n\n## Draft\n|Round|Pick|Player|Position|Nationality|College/Club|Outcome|Ref.|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|1|10|Ajša Sivka|F|Slovenia|Tarbes Gespe Bigorre|Rights retained| |\n|1|11|Hailey Van Lith|G|United States|TCU|Signed rookie contract April 23Made opening day roster| |\n|2|16|Maddy Westbeld|F|United States|Notre Dame|Signed rookie contract April 22Made opening day roster| |\n|2|22|Aicha Coulibaly|G|Mali|Texas A&M|Rights retained| |... ## Transactions\n\n### Front office and coaching\n|Date|Details|Ref.|\n|--|--|--|\n|September 27, 2024|Fired head coach, Teresa Weatherspoon| |\n|November 3, 2024|Hired Tyler Marsh as head coach| |\n|December 18, 2024|Hired Courtney Paris as an assistant coach| |\n|January 4, 2025|Hired Tanisha Wright as an assistant coach| |\n|March 24, 2025|Hired Rena Wakama as an assistant coach| |\n|March 27, 2025|Hired Donnie Marsh as a basketball operations specialist| |\n|March 27, 2025|Promoted David Simon to director of player development| |\n|April 21, 2025|Hired Aaron Johnson as a player development coach| |\n\n### Trades\n|February|February|February|February|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|February 4|To **Chicago Sky****Rebecca Allen**|To **Connecticut Sun**Lindsay AllenRights to Nikolina Milić| |\n|February 7|To **Chicago Sky****2025 No. 16 draft pick2025 No. 22 draft pick**|To **Las Vegas Aces**Dana Evans (sign-and-trade)| |\n|February 23|To **Chicago Sky****Ariel Atkins**|To **Washington Mystics**2025 No. 3 draft pick2027 second round draft pickRights to swap 2027 first round draft picks| |\n|April|April|April|April|\n|April 13|To **Chicago Sky****2025 No. 11 draft pick**|To **Minnesota Lynx**Outright 2026 first-round draft pickExtinguished previous right to exchange 2026 first round draft picks with Chicago| |... ### Subtractions / unsigned\n|Player|Date|Reason|New Team|Ref.|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|María Conde|December 6, 2024|Expansion draft|Golden State Valkyries| |\n|Diamond DeShields|February 3, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|Connecticut Sun| |\n|Brianna Turner|February 16, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|Indiana Fever| |\n|Isabelle Harrison|February 21, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|New York Liberty| |\n|Aicha Coulibaly|April 14, 2025|Unsigned draft pick(2025 draft pick – No. 22)|N/A – retained rights| |\n|Ajša Sivka|April 14, 2025|Unsigned draft pick(2025 draft pick – No. 10)|N/A – retained rights| |\n|Chennedy Carter|April 25, 2025|Free agency – unrestricted|Adelitas de Chihuahua| |\n|Tilly Boler|May 3, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Arella Guirantes|May 3, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Sammie Puisis|May 3, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Morgan Bertsch|May 11, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Jessika Carter|May 11, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Alex Wilson|May 11, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Kamilla Cardoso|June 25, 2025|Suspended contract – temporary|N/A – retained rights| |\n|Moriah Jefferson|July 28, 2025|Waived|—| |\n|Marquesha Davis|July 28, 2025|Released|—| |... </td><td>9–28 </td></tr><tr><td>38 </td><td>August 28 </td><td>@ Phoenix </td><td>L 79–83 </td><td>Kia Nurse (17) </td><td>Angel Reese (20) </td><td>Cardoso, Nurse, Reese (4) </td><td>PHX Arena10,445 </td><td>9–29 </td></tr><tr><td>39 </td><td>August 30 </td><td>@ Seattle </td><td>L 69–79 </td><td>Angel Reese (20) </td><td>Cardoso, Reese (10) </td><td>Ariel Atkins (8) </td><td>Climate Pledge Arena12,500 </td><td>9–30 </td></tr></table>|\n|September : 1–4 (Home: 1–1;

                "snippet": "# From streets to stadiums: Sky Brown, the youngest Olympic Medallist\n\nEmmy Schouten\n\nSky Brown (16) is one of the most talented skateboarders at this years Olympics. After her bronze medal in Tokyo, Sky is hungry for more. We’ll show you her journey to the Paris Olympics!\n\nMulti-talented\n\nSky Brown is half-British half-Japanese! Born in Miyazaki, her original name is Sukai Buraun (スカイ). Her dad Stuart is British, making here eligible to represent the UK on the Olympics. But he moved to the US before she was born. Sky spends half the year in Japan and the other half in the United States for school. She knows how to keep herself busy. If she’s not skateboarding, you can find her surfing, following guitar lessons or doing some jiu jitsu. Especially surfing is one of her big talents. Her original plan was to compete in\n\n*both* skateboarding and surfing at the Paris Olympics. She failed to qualify at the World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico. Despite not hitting her goal, everybody is super proud. And she’ll definitely try again for the 2028 Olympics ;). Her skateboarding career is the most successful yet. Sky started out with some YouTube tutorials and never had a coach. You can find her practicing in Huntington Beach LA. Sometimes she is joined by 3-time gold snowboarding medallist Shaun White who lives just around the corner.... Fun fact: Did you know that know that Sky won\n\n*Dancing with The Stars; Juniors* in 2018? Prizes\n\nAt just 9-years old, Sky participated in the Vans US Open. The youngest ever to do so! One year later, she became a professional skateboarder, again the youngest ever to do so ;). After her professional debut the prizes started coming. Sky won bronze and gold on the World Championships, two gold medals on the X Games, and silver and gold on the Dew Tour. But her best achievement was at the Tokyo Olympics. It was the year skateboarding debuted on the Olympics. Sky immediately took home bronze. At 13 years old, this made her the youngest UK Olympic medallist ever.\n\nA big inspiration\n\nHer skateboarding achievements inspire girls all over the globe. She became an instant role model. With partnerships from Nike, shoe and skate collaborations, Sky created her own brand. People come up to her wearing her helmet or using her skateboard. It pushes her to be the best version of herself everyday. Her message is clear: don’t care what people think. Everybody just has one life and you can’t let anybody stop you from what you want to do. It is her dream to inspire girls. Not even just in skateboarding, but whatever they want to do. This “Sky Brown-effect” is huge in the UK. In the last 5 years, skateboarding in London grew with 800%! A major part of this is girls hitting the streets after Sky’s Olympic performance.... No pressure\n\nEven with all eyes on her, Sky feels no pressure. Skateboarding is all about fun for her. She never sees it as practicing, it is her happy-place. Skating is her “playground”, and this year La Concorde in Paris will be hers. See her in action on August 6!",

                "snippet": "When 13-year-old professional skateboarding and surfing sensation Sky Brown was voted the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year in late 2021 – after being Great Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist at the Tokyo Games wining skateboarding park Bronze – she shared an exciting Gold Medal ambition for Paris 2024 that could be transformative for British surfing and skateboarding: “I want to get two Gold Medals in Paris, for Great Britain, in skateboarding and surfing.” Sky is not a person to make empty promises. Taking gold at The World Skate Championships Olympic qualifying event in Sharjah, UA, she is fully aware of her potential.... ## Joining Team GB\n\nBorn in Miyazaki Japan and raised between the USA and Japan, with a British father and Japanese mother, Sky is a young woman of the world. So, it’s a blessing for British actions sports that she has chosen to represent Team GB in her beloved board riding disciplines. With the opportunity to compete for a number of nations, Sky explained how it was “the more relaxed approach of the British Skateboarding Association” that appealed to her free-spirited style. “I begged my parents to let me go with Team GB,” she said. Her dad Stuart added, “We chose Great Britain because we felt that there was no pressure and they didn’t ask us to commit. They made it very clear that if she wasn’t happy or wasn’t feeling good at any time we could pull out.”... ## It runs in the family... Action sports culture runs deep through the Brown family. Sky’s dad Stuart is a long-time surfer and skater. “He built a backyard mini ramp in our place in California,” said Sky, “and skated everyday with his friends, and I would steal his board, which became my favourite toy when I was small.” Sky’s learning curve was remarkable. At age eight she was in the Vans US Open, the youngest skater ever to compete at the event. At 10 she signed a professional contract with Nike, again breaking records as their youngest athlete. And Sky’s skate style oozes with maturity – smooth, flowing, powerful, all with expert timing born in the arcs and angles of surfing. The family normally surf dawn patrols on the Californian coast around Orange County. “Surfing helps with my skating,” says Sky.... “It’s pretty similar, so if the waves are good, I will surf for three to four hours.” She combines home-schooling with two days each week in class, and skates every afternoon - usually at Prince Park in Oceanside or Poods in Encinitas.... ## Dancing with the stars\n\nSky’s fame skyrocketed after winning ‘Dancing with the Stars Juniors’ in 2018 (the US version of ‘Strictly Come Dancing’) - with US teen dancer JT Church. “We didn’t really know what the show was about,” said Stuart (after the show approached the family, having seen Sky’s growing presence in the skateboarding world). “My wife and Sky started watching it on an iPad. I went to bed and when I woke up at 3am they were still watching it! Sky turned to me and said, ‘Daddy, can I do this show?’ She ended up turning down The X Games – something she’d always wanted to do – to do Dancing with the Stars.”... “It was one of the most fun things I’ve ever done because I’m a girly girl and I got to dance and get my hair and makeup done,” said Sky. Dancing on stage transferred to the concrete with rhythm and tempo becoming key features of Sky’s skate park routines.... ## You've got to get back up\n\nDespite her age, she was heading into Tokyo as a medal contender, already the first female to land a frontside 540. Then, while skating on a mega ramp she fell 15 feet and suffered skull fractures (her helmet saving her life) and a broken wrist and hand. Four days later, knowing she would make a full recovery, she wanted to share the experience on social media:... “People might think I'm super girl or something, but I want to show sometimes you're going to fall. I want to spread the message that it's OK to fall sometimes, you are going to fall, all your heroes are going to fall. I wanted to show you've got to get back up and keep on going. Falling is part of life and that can't stop what you're doing. It was heavy for my parents, it was heavy for my family, but it made me stronger.”... ## Skateboarding for everyone\n\n“I think we showed everyone how beautiful skateboarding is. It’s more of a family vibe, and we’re always pushing each other to do more, to go further. I really hope I inspire some girls. Anyone can do skateboarding. You don’t have to be of a certain height or a certain age – you can do it whenever you want. You’ve just got to skate and go for it. I want to make Britain proud as much as I can, and I hope I did. And I want to inspire the world, especially little girls, and teach them that skateboarding is for everyone. I mean, if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.”... ## It's more than just competition\n\nDespite the obvious shared stoke among competitors at the Olympic skate park, what appears to fuel the competitive fire in Sky is the sibling rivalry she has with her younger brother Ocean, also a red hot skater and surfer. “We compete in everything,” affirms Sky. They share a YouTube channel with a huge and growing fanbase. \"I want to push boundaries, keep on improving, and try to close the gender gap as much as I can,” says Sky, who fears losing to her brother above all else. “I have so many dreams, but one now is to go to underprivileged places and teach kids to skate, because I feel like skateboarding – and other sports – helps people who are struggling.”... ## The Olympics\n\nAnd it’s the Olympic torch that remains so important for Sky’s ever-hotter flame. With a cycle of Paris, Los Angeles and Brisbane coming up, Olympic performance could define her career in the way it did for snowboarder and three times Gold Medallist Shaun White. Sky repeats, “My next big dream is to go to the Olympics in Paris 2024 in skateboarding and surfing and hopefully to win two medals for Britain. That would be really cool.”",

                "snippet": "# Scientific Consensus\n\nIt’s important to remember that scientists always focus on the evidence, not on opinions. Scientific evidence continues to show that human activities (primarily the human burning of fossil fuels) have warmed Earth’s surface and its ocean basins, which in turn have continued to impact Earth’s climate. This is based on over a century of scientific evidence forming the structural backbone of today's civilization.\n\nNASA Global Climate Change presents the state of scientific knowledge about climate change while highlighting the role NASA plays in better understanding our home planet. This effort includes citing multiple peer-reviewed studies from research groups across the world,\n\n1 illustrating the accuracy and consensus of research results (in this case, the scientific consensus on climate change) consistent with NASA’s scientific research portfolio.\n\nWith that said, multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals\n\n1 show that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources.... ## American Scientific Societies\n\n### Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations\n\n\"Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.\" (2009)\n\n2\n\n### American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\n\"Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening.\" (2014)\n\n3\n\n### American Chemical Society\n\n\"The Earth’s climate is changing in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and particulate matter in the atmosphere, largely as the result of human activities.\" (2016-2019)\n\n4\n\n### American Geophysical Union\n\n\"Based on extensive scientific evidence, it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. There is no alterative explanation supported by convincing evidence.\" (2019)\n\n5\n\n### American Medical Association\n\n\"Our AMA ... supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.\" (2019)\n\n6\n\n### American Meteorological Society\n\n\"Research has found a human influence on the climate of the past several decades ... The IPCC (2013), USGCRP (2017), and USGCRP (2018) indicate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-twentieth century.\" (2019)\n\n7... ### American Physical Society\n\n\"Earth's changing climate is a critical issue and poses the risk of significant environmental, social and economic disruptions around the globe. While natural sources of climate variability are significant, multiple lines of evidence indicate that human influences have had an increasingly dominant effect on global climate warming observed since the mid-twentieth century.\" (2015)\n\n8\n\n### The Geological Society of America\n\n\"The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2011), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program (Melillo et al., 2014) that global climate has warmed in response to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases ... Human activities (mainly greenhouse-gas emissions) are the dominant cause of the rapid warming since the middle 1900s (IPCC, 2013).\" (2015)\n\n9\n\n## Science Academies\n\n### International Academies: Joint Statement\n\n\"Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001).\" (2005, 11 international science academies)\n\n1 0... ## U.S. Government Agencies\n\n### U.S. Global Change Research Program\n\n\"Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.\" (2018, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies)\n\n12\n\n## Intergovernmental Bodies\n\n### Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\n“It is unequivocal that the increase of CO\n\n2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.\n\n“Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activity on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact.”\n\n1 3-17... ## Other Resources\n\n### List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations\n\nThe following page lists the nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action.\n\nhttp://www.opr.ca.gov/facts/list-of-scientific-organizations.html\n\n### U.S. Agencies\n\nThe following page contains information on what federal agencies are doing to adapt to climate change.\n\nhttps://www.c2es.org/site/assets/uploads/2012/02/climate-change-adaptation-what-federal-agencies-are-doing.pdf\n\n*Technically, a “consensus” is a general agreement of opinion, but the scientific method steers us away from this to an objective framework. In science, facts or observations are explained by a hypothesis (a statement of a possible explanation for some natural phenomenon), which can then be tested and retested until it is refuted (or disproved).*\n\n*As scientists gather more observations, they will build off one explanation and add details to complete the picture. Eventually, a group of hypotheses might be integrated and generalized into a scientific theory, a scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.*... ### References\n\n**1.** K.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... Pacific Coast observers will see the pair of shadows at the onset of morning twilight Oct. 25, the last in this series for the month.\nVenus rises at 5 a.m. local daylight time on Oct. 1, shining at magnitude –3.9 among the stars of Leo. It crosses into Virgo by the 9th and its elongation from the Sun is declining, so it rises later each morning. It's joined by the waning crescent Moon on the 19th; the pair rises around 5:30 a.m. across North America. They stand less than 4° apart, with the Moon just two days from New. Through a telescope, Venus displays a 94-percent-lit disk spanning 11″.\nBy the end of October, the phase expands to 96 percent and the disk shrinks to 10″. On the 31st Venus stands 4° north of Spica, although the magnitude 1.0 star is difficult to see in the brightening sky.\nNote: Moon phases in the calendar vary in size due to the distance from Earth and are shown at 0h Universal Time.

In the south lie the elongated Schiller and the detail-packed Gassendi; the equator sports the small and sharp Kepler, leading north to the outstanding half-ring of the Jura Mountains. Keep going north for some lunar history.... The Orionids' radiant is highest early in the morning. Uranus may be visible to sharp-eyed observers without optical aid. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nComet Search: Watch it move!\nFalling steeply into the Sun's gravity well, Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) drops in from the Oort Cloud for a brief two-month visit. By month's end it peaks around 8th magnitude, comparable to Messier galaxies, in the northwest and is accessible to 3-inch scopes from a country location.\nDiscovered in January by D.C. Fuls with the Mount Lemmon Survey in Arizona, this mile-sized ball of dirt and ice is headed to a point half the Sun-Earth distance before shooting back out.\nSkip October's first two weeks, then get ready to jump. As darkness descends, Comet Lemmon is not much more than 20° high and sinks quickly into the horizon haze. Visual observers should note its position in a star field, then again 30 minutes later to see that it's shifted 1/6 the Moon's apparent diameter. Imagers will be happy with the green glow from carbon emission, but the 11″ displacement for a classic one-minute 'sub' will catch many off guard.

This causes heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, increasing the planet’s surface temperature.\n\nThe panel, which is made up of scientists from around the world, including researchers from B.C., has warned for decades that wildfires and severe weather, such as the province’s deadly heat dome and catastrophic flooding in 2021, would become more frequent and intense because of the climate emergency. It has issued a code red for humanity and warns the window to limit warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial times is closing.\n\nAccording to NASA climate scientists, human activities have raised the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide content by 50 per cent in less than 200 years, and “there is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate.”\n\nAs of Sept. 5, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 425.48 parts per million, down slightly from 427.87 ppm last month, according to NOAA data measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory, a global atmosphere monitoring lab in Hawaii. The NOAA notes there has been a steady rise in CO2 from under 320 ppm in 1960.... ### Climate change quick facts:\n\n• The Earth is now about 1.3 C warmer than it was in the 1800s.\n\n• 2024 was hottest year on record globally, beating the record in 2023.\n\n• The global average temperature in 2023 reached 1.48 C higher than the pre-industrial average, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. In 2024, it breached the 1.5 C threshold at 1.55 C.\n\n• The past 10 years (2015-2024) are the 10 warmest on record.\n\n• Human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by nearly 49 per cent above pre-industrial levels starting in 1850.\n\n• The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change including sea level rise, and more intense drought, heat waves and wildfires.\n\n• On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, the temperature could increase by as much 3.6 C this century, according to the IPCC.\n\n• In June 2025, global concentrations of carbon dioxide exceeded 430 parts per million, a record high.\n\n• Emissions must drop 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C and 2.7 per cent per year to stay below 2 C.\n\n• There is global scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that humans are the cause.\n\n• Scientific information taken from natural sources (such as ice cores, rocks, and tree rings) and from modern equipment (like satellites and instruments) all show the signs of a changing climate.\n\n(Sources for quick facts: United Nations IPCC, World Meteorological Organization, UNEP, NASA, climatedata.ca)... ### UN agency says CO2 levels hit record high last year, causing more extreme weather\n\nHeat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a level not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, the United Nations weather agency said Wednesday.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said in its latest bulletin on greenhouse gases, an annual study released ahead of the U.N.’s annual climate conference, that CO2 growth rates have now tripled since the 1960s, and reached levels that existed more than 800,000 years ago.\n\nEmissions from burning coal, oil and gas, alongside more wildfires, have helped fan a “vicious climate cycle,” as people and industries continue to spew heat-trapping gases while the planet’s oceans and forests lose their ability to absorb them, the WMO report said.\n\nThe Geneva-based agency said the increase in the global average concentration of carbon dioxide from 2023 to 2024 amounted to the highest annual level of any one-year span since measurements began in 1957. Growth rates of CO2 have accelerated from an annual average increase of 2.4 parts per million per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020, to 3.5 ppm from 2023 to 2024, it said.\n\n“The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbocharging our climate and leading to more extreme weather,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett in a statement. “Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being.”\n\n*—The Associated Press*... ### ‘I’m the same me’: Canada’s Mark Carney defends his climate record\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he’s focused on climate policies that are likely to have the greatest impact at a time of strained resources and multiple crises, denying criticisms that he’s back pedalling on actions to protect the environment.\n\n“What we need to do is to be as effective as possible, in terms of addressing climate change while growing our economy,” he said during a podcast interview for Bloomberg Weekend’s The Mishal Husain Show.\n\nDespite deep green credentials — including a five-year stint as United Nations special envoy for climate change — Carney has scrapped a number of environmental policies introduced by his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and struck a notably friendlier tone on fossil fuel production. He’s fast-tracked approval for a liquefied natural gas export facility expansion in B.C., opened the door to the possibility of a new oil pipeline to the country’s West Coast, and hasn’t ruled out abandoning plans for an emissions cap for oil and gas producers.\n\nPressed on his plans for the cap, Carney repeatedly responded that “a desired outcome” — in this case emissions reduction — “is not a policy.”\n\n“What makes those emissions go down will be carbon capture and storage,” he said. The former central banker has previously said carbon capture could be part of a “grand bargain” with the province of Alberta that would allow it to increase its fossil fuel exports via a new oil pipeline.\n\n*—Bloomberg News*... ### Southern resident killer whales show signs of slow decline toward disappearance\n\nThe latest survey of endangered southern resident killer whales confirms their plateau and gradual slide toward disappearance in the absence of stronger measures to protect them, a director with the U.S.-based Center for Whale Research says.\n\nMichael Weiss says declining chinook populations, pollutants and noise from ships in the orcas’ habitat off the coast of Washington State and southern B.C. are among the factors driving the decline.\n\n“We’re not talking about southern residents going extinct in the next five years, but we are talking about a fairly good chance of at least one of the (three) pods being gone within the next 50 years,” Weiss said.\n\nThe long-term work of restoring chinook habitat, particularly freshwater spawning grounds, along with adjusting fisheries, would be key to the orcas’ recovery, says Weiss.\n\nHis remarks come with the release on Monday of an annual survey by the organization based in Washington State, offering a snapshot of the population of southern residents as of July 1. This year’s survey found the overall population was 74, up by one from last year.\n\nDuring the census period, researchers documented four births among all three distinct pods of southern residents, but only two calves survived, it says.\n\n*—The Canadian Press*... ### The world is heading to add 57 super hot days a year, but study indicates it could have been worse\n\nThe world is on track to add nearly two months of dangerous super hot days each year by the end of the century, with poorer small nations hit far more often than the biggest carbon-polluting countries, a study released Thursday found.\n\nBut efforts to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that started 10 years ago with the Paris climate agreement have had a significant effect. Without them Earth would be heading to an additional 114 days a year of those deadly extra hot days, the same study found.\n\nThe international collection of climate scientists World Weather Attribution and the U.S.-based Climate Central teamed up to use computer simulations to calculate just how much of a difference the landmark accord has made in terms of one of the biggest climate effects on people: heat waves.\n\nThe report — which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution — calculated how many super hot days the world and more than 200 countries got in 2015, how many Earth gets now and what’s projected in two future scenarios.\n\nOne scenario is if countries fulfil their promises to curb emissions and by the year 2100 the world warms 2.6 C above preindustrial times. That adds 57 super hot days to what Earth gets now, according to the study. The other scenario is the 4 C of warming that the world had been on track to hit before the Paris agreement. The study found that would double the number of additional hot days.\n\n*—The Associated Press*",

                "snippet": "**PROVIDENCE, R.I.** [Brown University] — People who dispute scientific consensus on topics such as vaccine efficacy, climate change or the Big Bang tend to overestimate their own knowledge of these subjects, a new study has shown.\n\nThe study, led by scholars at Brown University, Portland State University and the University of Colorado Boulder, surveyed thousands of Americans online, quizzing them on scientific facts and soliciting their opinions on eight contested topics, including the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe scholars found that respondents who answered more factual questions correctly were more likely to agree with the scientific consensus about each topic. On the other hand, those who answered many factual questions incorrectly but thought they understood certain topics well were more likely to disagree with the scientific consensus. For example, many who said in July 2020 that they would “definitely not get the vaccine” incorrectly answered questions about how viruses spread and how vaccines work, but then said they thought they had a “thorough understanding” of how a COVID-19 vaccine would work.\n\nThe research was published in Science Advances.\n\nSteven Sloman, a co-author of the study and a professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown, said the findings demonstrate that whether or not people agree with scientists doesn’t just depend on how well they understand the science — it also depends on how well they perceive their own understanding. The research also shows the extent to which alternative facts have taken hold in many communities.... “It is a sad fact that our society has returned to an era in which many people’s sense of what’s true is governed more by the beliefs of the people around them than by the hard work of scientists using evidence to test their hypotheses,” Sloman said.\n\nNick Light, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of marketing at Portland State University, said the study reveals why fact-based educational interventions have had only limited success in convincing people to, say, get vaccinated or reduce their individual carbon footprints.\n\n“For many years, smart people thought that the way to bring people more in line with scientific consensus was to teach them the knowledge they lacked,” Light said. “Unfortunately, our research suggests that there may be a problem of overconfidence getting in the way of learning… If people think they know a lot, they have minimal motivation to learn more.”",

As a result, \nshutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is likely within the next 20-30 \nyears, unless actions are taken to reduce global warming – in contradiction to conclusions of IPCC. If \nAMOC is allowed to shut down, it will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several meters – \nthus, we describe AMOC shutdown as the “point of no return.”\nWe suggest that an alternative perspective – a complement to the IPCC approach – is needed to assess \nthese issues and actions that are needed to avoid handing young people a dire situation that is out of their \ncontrol. This alternative approach will make more use of ongoing observations to drive modeling and \nmore use of paleoclimate to test modeling and test our understanding.

Te large \n1991 Pinatubo eruption allows the aerosol forcing to be defned and provide a test of climate impact. Prediction11 \nof global cooling by Pinatubo aerosols was made soon afer the eruption based on initial estimates of aerosol \namount, with peak aerosol forcing −4.5 W/m2 and predicted global cooling 0.5 °C. Later multispectral aerosol \nopacity data of the SAGE satellite instrument12 allowed precise evaluation of opacity of the Pinatubo aerosol layer \nand the dispersion of aerosol sizes,13 which revealed peak forcing as actually −3 W/m2. Multiple runs of a GCM \n(global climate model) with this aerosol forcing produced maximum global cooling afer the volcano of 0.3 °C and \na maximum decrease of Earth’s energy balance of 3 W/m2 (Figure 5) consistent with ERBE satellite observations.14...

We reduced Pinatubo forcing accordingly and smoothed the Pinatubo forcing curve14 \nwith a 3-month running-mean to obtain our estimate of the Hunga forcing. Later estimates (NASA and USask)16,17 \nbased on satellite data bracket the estimate based on Pinatubo but have earlier peak opacity, likely due to the higher \nlatitude of the Hunga eruption, which placed the aerosols closer to where they descend from the stratosphere.\nFigure S3.

                "snippet": "# What's in the sky October 2025\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nWelcome to your October guide to the Southern Hemisphere night sky! This month, we’ve got a fantastic mix of planets, deep sky objects, and even a rare comet to chase. Whether you’re a casual stargazer enjoying the view with binoculars, a telescope enthusiast hunting planets and nebulae, or an astrophotographer capturing the wonders above, there’s plenty to see and explore. From bright planets like Saturn and Mercury to stunning deep sky gems like the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Helix Nebula, October promises plenty of celestial highlights to keep your nights busy.\n\n**Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN**\n\nThis month brings a rare visitor from the outer Solar System: Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, which reaches its closest approach on October 19th, just 0.261 AU from Earth. Last seen in the inner Solar System over 20,000 years ago.\n\nImage Credit: Mike Kane\n\nAfter perihelion on September 12, it developed a striking 5° corkscrew-shaped ion tail visible in photographs. That’s about the length of 10 Full Moons! Currently around magnitude 6, it’s visible with binoculars low on the western horizon just after sunset. Look near Mars and Spica in Virgo to help spot it. As it approaches Earth, it may brighten to magnitude 4, possibly making it visible to the naked eye under dark skies.. This closest approach is due to happen on the 19... th of October, so pencil in the days between the 18 th till the 21 st, as that will hopefully be one of the best opportunities this year to observe a comet. The comet will continue moving through Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius before fading in early November.\n\nAnd since comets can surprise us with sudden changes in brightness or appearance, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN. Look out for an updated video and article from us right before the best viewing nights so you’ll know exactly what to expect and how to spot it.\n\n**Mercury**\n\nThis month, we’ve also got the 2\n\nnd best opportunity of the year to observe Mercury, as it reaches its greatest elongation on the 29 th of October. This is when Mercury reaches it’s greatest distance in the sky from the Sun and makes it the best time to observe the planet.\n\nThe greatest elongation of the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is kind of like their version of opposition. It’s not quite the same, as it’s not when the planet is at it’s largest, but it represents the best opportunity to observe the planet, as it signifies when the planet appears to be the farthest distance form the sun in our sky.... If you don’t have an opportunity to observe on exactly the 29\n\nth, don’t worry! While planetary opposition and elongation events are typically given as just one date, the truth is that while this date represents the absolute peak, observing up to a week before or after is often 90% as good! So don’t think you’ve missed out, you haven’t!\n\n**Saturn**\n\nSpeaking of opposition, while Saturn’s opposition has already passed, secretly we actually think now may be a better time to observe. Why? Because while Saturn is ever so slightly smaller than last month, it’s rising earlier in the night, making it easier to observe for those of us keen to maintain a reasonable bedtime!\n\nWhile the best viewing window is still a little late, between 10 and 12pm, you’ll still get great views of the planet anytime after sunset, and Saturn should be fairly easy to spot in the Northeastern area of the sky.\n\n**Neptune**\n\nOnce again Neptune joins us alongside Saturn in the Sky. If you’ve got a scope big enough (we’d typically recommend and aperture of 6 inches or larger), and you can See Saturn in the sky, then you’ll be able to spot Neptune. There’s not much worth looking at in it’s own right, but if you’re already observing Saturn, you may as well turn your scope to the furthest planet in the Solar system.... Like Saturn, Neptune is best observed between 10-12pm, but you’ll be able to see it anytime after sunset.\n\nIf you’re up late, this month also represents a good time to have a look at Uranus. Again if you’ve got the aperture, you’ll see a tiny grey-blue disk. This month it’s really only for the most dedicated planet hunters, as to have a good view of it, you’ll need to be up between 1-3am, as that’s when it’s best positioned for observing in the sky.... ###\n\n**Uranus**\n\n**Deep Sky Objects This Month**\n\n**The Small Magellanic Cloud/SMC (NGC 292)**\n\nThe main attraction this month is one of the gems of the Southern sky, The Small Magellanic cloud. While it doesn’t take up as much of the sky as it’s cousin the Large Magellanic cloud (more on this incredible object come January), there’s nothing Small about this cloud of stars, as it stretches 4 degrees across in the sky (that’s 8 moons across!).\n\nImage Credit: ESO/VISTA VMC\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud, or SMC for short is a satellite galaxy of the Milkyway, meaning the SMC orbits the Milky way much in a similar way to how the Moon orbits the Earth! It’s exclusively visible to us in the southern hemisphere, and is easily one of the gems of the southern sky.\n\nThe SMC is visible to the naked eye from dark sites with little light pollution, and in fact is one of the furthest objects visible with the naked eye, at a distance of 200,000 light years away. Up the magnification and light gathering with a pair of Binoculars and the SMC will stand out even more, and you’ll also be able to make out some of the details of the galaxy itself. Up the Magnification and light gathering even more with a large telescope, and individual features within the SMC become resolvable.... Another great target this month is NGC 7293, the Helix Nebula. Often also known by the much more dramatic name, the Eye of God Nebula, the Helix Nebula is one of the closest Planetary Nebula to Earth, which makes it one of the rare planetary Nebula in the sky large enough to make out considerable detail through a telescope, as well as being large enough to be a great target astrophotography target for small refractors and Smart telescopes.\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nThrough the eyepiece, you’ll see an eye shape staring right back, and you’ll see more details the darker your sky, and if you have a UHC filter like this one to boost contrast: https://bintel.com.au/products/astronomik-uhc-filter.\n\nPlanetary nebulae like the Helix are formed during the final stages of a medium-sized star’s life. When stars similar in size to our Sun exhaust the fuel in their cores, they shed their outer layers into space, creating an expanding shell of glowing gas. The exposed hot core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation that excites the surrounding gas, causing it to shine in the striking colours we see in photographs. Planetary nebulae aren’t uncommon in the galaxy, but the Helix is special because it’s one of the closest and brightest, making its structure and details much easier to observe.... The Helix Nebula is another quintessentially Southern object. While it is technically observable from the Northern Hemisphere, they don’t get to see it quite like we do, as we get to see it rise right overhead in the night sky.\n\nYou’ll find the Helix nebula in the constellation Aquarius, and it’s best observed between 8 to 10pm, when its at its highest in the night sky.\n\nAnd that brings an end to this month’s guide to the night sky. October offers an incredible variety of observing opportunities for Southern Hemisphere stargazers. From the bright planets like Saturn, Mercury, and Neptune, to a rare visitor from the outer Solar System in Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, there’s something for every type of observer, no matter if you’re up late hunting faint outer planets or enjoying a relaxed evening spotting a comet low on the horizon. The deep sky is equally rewarding, with the Small Magellanic Cloud and its internal treasures like NGC 346, as well as the Helix Nebula, giving both visual observers and astrophotographers stunning targets to explore. With clear skies, dark horizons, and a mix of familiar and extraordinary objects, October is shaping up to be a month that truly showcases the richness of our southern night sky.",

NASA his­\ntory is important as a way to help understand the \ntechnological and societal implications of the space \nage. Furthermore, in looking at NASA’s use of out­\nside scientific advice, we seek to understand what \ngood has come from it, whether it has had signifi­\ncant impacts, and if so, in what ways. The answers \nto such questions, of course, address the question \nof when NASA should seek outside advice. We ask \nhow well has the advisory process worked, what \nefforts worked well, what fell flat, and why? Are \nthere common attributes or recurring themes that \nhelp distinguish between effective efforts and run-\nof-the-mill communications? What are the distinc­\ntions between different sources of outside advice \nand are those distinctions relevant and important? \nFinally, given past experiences and trends, can one \ncount on the process working as well in the future, \nor are there obstacles to be anticipated and over­\ncome?

Part 1 briefly examines early forerunner \nactivities at NACA and in the decade leading up \nto NASA’s formation; it then considers NASA’s use \nof outside advice during its first three decades. Part \n2 picks up the story in 1988 and follows it up to \n2016. Part 3 examines a sampling of case studies, \ndiscusses recurring characteristics of notably suc­\ncessful advisory activities, and provides a glimpse \nof what past experience might imply for the future \nof scientific advice at NASA. The last two chap­\nters provide big-picture summaries of themes that \nhave emerged from earlier discussions.

The first — archival research — drew on... vii\nPreface\nformal process apart from the broader questions of \ngathering scientific advice. Nevertheless, many of \nthe attributes that make other advice effective will \napply to peer reviews as well.\nAlso for the sake of keeping the discussion \nfocused, the book looks mainly at scientific advi­\nsory committees established by NASA (deemed \ninternal committees) and bodies established by \nthe National Research Council (deemed external \ncommittees), especially the Space Science Board, \nits successor the Space Studies Board (SSB), and \ntheir cousins, the Space Applications Board and \nthe Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board. \nSeveral other NRC boards — notably the Board \non Physics and Astronomy, the Board on Atmo­\nspheric Sciences and Climate, the Board on Earth \nSciences and Resources, and the Board on Life Sci­\nences — have organized important advisory studies \nfor NASA. While the monograph’s discussions do \nnot ignore those bodies, the work of the SSB has \nbeen sufficiently extensive that the lessons from \nthe SSB-NASA experience should be more broadly \napplicable to the rest of the NRC in terms of advice \non NASA space and Earth science. \nFinally, there have been other entities besides \nNASA’s formally established internal committees \nand separate groups operating under the aegis of \nthe National Research Council that have provided \nadvice from time to time about the Agency’s sci­\nence programs. Examples include the National \nAcademy of Public Administration, scientific \nsocieties such as the American Astronomical Soci­\nety and the American Geophysical Union, public \ninterest groups such as The Planetary Society, and \na few “blue-ribbon” committees commissioned by \nthe government. The advisory roles of these bodies \nand their cousins have been rather more ad hoc \nand much less ubiquitous than the NASA and \nNRC committees. Given that lessons from the \nlarge body of experience with the latter are quite \nlikely to be relevant to the former, the monograph \nwill not dig into the history of scientific advice \nfrom groups other than those formed by NASA \nand the NRC.... nautics for four decades starting in the 1920s, and \nhe later collaborated with Wernher Von Braun in \ndeveloping the German V-2 rocket.

                "url": "https://www.astronomy.com/observing/october-2025-whats-in-the-southern-hemisphere-sky-this-month/",
                "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude. Located inside the border are the cardinal directions and their intermediate points. To find stars, hold the map overhead and orient it so one of the labels matches the direction you’re facing. The stars above the map’s horizon now match what’s in the sky.\n\nThe all-sky map shows how the sky looks at:\n\n10 p.m. October 1\n\n9 p.m. October 15\n\n8 p.m. October 31\n\nPlanets are shown at midmonthOctober2025-SouthernHemisphereDownload",

'm not done yet by the way i'm not done i do hope that you'll continue to watch this into the webinar it's a long video i recommend you take chunks of it at a time it's a lot it's kind of mind-bending information uh it's\ninformation people are not aware of they have not heard of they're completely like \"Wait what are you saying that's not what I was taught that's not what I've learned.\" Um it's like \"Yeah I know welcome to my world.\" So I want to start with this um there's a few truth bombs there's a few uh uh narratives I'... confronted a chemtrail pilot a cloud seating yes absolutely um cloud seating is generally happens with a Cessna airplane and they're using flares to essentially put out silver iodide and many times there's also a type of chaff that is included in this and this is so that they can through satellite actually trace where the the silver iodide is going to see if they actually hit their mark this is highly highly t targeted and highly highly {ts:794680} localized it is not the crisscrosses in in the sky whatsoever so there's a massive confusion around that and that is doing a disservice because it's making people believe that this individual confronted a chemtrail pilot therefore those streaks in the skies are chemtrails and we're being misdirected is what I can say is we're being misdirected from once again two years of research evidence legal team legal researchers meteorologists citizen uh researchers and through their research and efforts they have proven to me the current beliefs around geoengineering and its narrative are completely incorrect and I know I might sound a little mysterious to some of you that's why you've got to watch uh the our webinar from last night so there's that so that has to be clarified um nobody has ever confronted uh a chemtrail pilot um after you know watching flight radar and jumping in their car that has yet to to happen it... 's cloud seating cloud seating is with Cessna's thousand feet up so that need to be clarified big time now there's something else that I have to speak to and this is really really huge um essentially there has been a story continuously circulating that is once again incorrect and that has to do with uh gag orders there has been a story put out there and continues to be put out there that weather reporters meteorologists have been officially told by the government to shut up around identifying any kind of um weather modification weather manipulation programs going on and this\nhas been circulating as the answer to when people ask why don't we know about geoengineering why don't we know about these programs well it's because there's a gag order i thought this was true so two years ago our legal team from Houston Texas we were pursuing this as a first amendment violation by the federal government and it was our job to go out there and most importantly to find the original source document of that gag order from the federal government telling meteorologists and weather reporters not to talk about weather modification programs and what we {ts:929920} understood ultimately and found out because we heard from the actual attorneys who could provide that source document and essentially this is what they had to say this actually comes from the legal council of of what is known as the peer organization the public employees for environmental responsibility and what we found out is that there was no source document putting a gag order on weather reporters and meteorologists this gag order was actually about union negotiation and this was a confidentiality agreement during the negotiation uh that that they could not discuss what was going on behind the scenes during their collective bargaining agreement and Richard Hearn who is the general counsel of the peer organization as well as executive director let us know that there 100% unequivocally is no gag order has never been a gag order on any weather reporters or or meteorologists now again you might start calling me a shill or a CIA agent or something very exciting like And I just want to say all you need to... 've been applying that to our research and our legal work but the average person does not know that and when you say to them hey it's this not that they go oh no you're wrong these engines do not create condensation trails that's absolutely 100% false information why is it important for you to know this because it's leading us down the wrong trail and as we were discussing last night I think what's happened whether it was by design or inadvertently we have this big bad boogeyman out there uh as Jim Lee says it's the straw man and we're told to look way out there for the big bad boogeyman and I guarantee you there's clandestine programs so this is by the way what what we're speaking to is not\nmutually exclusive it's not one or the other it can still be both but the point is this is while we're out there looking for the needle in the haststack which are the clandestine programs we actually have commercial aviation which are now up to 43 million flights over our heads that have jet exhaust that we see that is spewing over us whether you see the condensation trails or not day in day out day in day out and that number is rising exponentially now what's important to this as well is that when we had the individual confronting the chemtrail pilot this individual was stating that her rainwater results showed essentially I guess um chemtrails proof chemtrails mind you she was speaking to a a uh cloud seating pilot and those rainwater {ts:1203919} samples do not reflect cloud seating they do not reflect chemtrails in the way that we think they are those rainwater samples reflect commercial aviation exhaust this actually is what is coming from the exhaust of the jet fuel itself and I know this for a fact why because we Save Our Skies paid for eight of those those very specific rainwater samples from this individual we paid for eight of them for Save Our Skies for illegal pursuit and we paid for them and we saw the results and they reflected jet exhaust nothing else jet exhaust so again that that narrative has to be corrected it... 's misrepresentative of what's really going on and the high bypass turbo fan engines is also misrepresentative of what's really going on and I think what's happened here is that we have been led to look for that needle in the haystack thinking that that is going to if we if we stop it it's you know and get it out of there it's going to bring back the blue skies but it's actually the hay stack that's the problem it's right it's right in front\nof us it's it's it's we don't need to look for the needle it's it's the haystack itself and what is the haystack commercial aviation and people have a hard hard time hearing that why because for years now for years now they've been convinced by certain other individuals who have been scaring the Jesus out of us telling us it's these clandestine programs and again I'm not saying these are not clandestine programs going on america has a history of clandestine programs well doumented this is not an eitheror it's not one or the other my job the job of our Saver Skies team and all the consultants and all the researchers who have been assisting us and holding our hand and and opening our eyes it's been our job to get down to what is real why because we want to be effective so ultimately and we'll get into this when all the geoengineering {ts:1336799} legislation started passing in the states it... 're seeing and know what they're not seeing and be able to delineate between myth and fact and our objective is so that you can look up and go okay this is the day we should be seeing streaks in the sky persistent contrails or this is the day we should\nnot be seeing them whatsoever what is that why am I seeing a persistent contrail and guess what bingo Eureka you are actually uncovering a geoengineering clandestine program right so if the conditions are such where you should not be seeing it and you're like wait a second what is that you've just probably found that needle in the hay stack that is what we've been trying to teach people to do so you know what to expect and when something's unusual it'll pop out at you and we've been teaching that and that has been also through the most accurate narrative the most fact-based and scientifically based information that we have at our hands and to then have individuals continuously go out there repeat the false narrative that there's a gag order that's why you don't know about these clandestine programs that's that are happening everywhere uh and and to continue the false narrative that these high bypass turboan engines uh do not create persistent contrails absolutely uh it is actually covering and clouding {ts:1589360} the truth and then to have the belief that you can use flight radar and track down chemtrail pilots and put them in their place is absolutely also in inaccurate and doing an extraordinary disservice to our fight and to winning and I",

Precious people, there is a\n{ts:4} fake message being spread online. Some claiming that the mightest prophet of the Lord has said that the world will\n{ts:10} end on the 2nd of August. Uh let me say this clearly and without hesitation. That is a lie. It is false and it is not\n{ts:19} from the prophet. [Music] [Music]\n{ts:39} Now what the prophet has always preached if you have followed this ministry even briefly if you have followed the\n{ts:46} ministry of repentance and holiness the ministry of the mightiest prophet of the lord you already know that the that what\n{ts:52} prophet waras never given is a spec a specific date. He has never given a specific date for the end of the\n{ts:60} world or the rapture. In fact, he has consistently and publicly preached that no one knows the day, the hour,\n{ts:69} just as the Lord Jesus said uh in the book of Matthew 24:36. Again, I think I should quote that. The\n{ts:76} book of Matthew 24:36 the Bible says uh but about that day or hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the... {ts:175} that the servants of the Lord have gone to. Even here in Australia, the servant of\n{ts:181} God has always proclaimed the message, the same message, the message of prepare the way the Messiah is coming and the\n{ts:190} need to turn away from sin and live a right and live in righteousness because uh the coming of the Lord is\n{ts:196} very very near precious people and uh never has he ever said that the world will end on this particular date. Not\n{ts:204} now. Be always on the guard. Be always watchful.\n{ts:217} Be always prepared. [Music] Be ready all the time\n{ts:225} and looking up all the time because nobody knows the day or the hour.\n{ts:231} [Music] and pray that you may be able to escape what is about to happen to the whole\n{ts:236} earth. That's a deliberate prayer direct. Now the source and motive behind the lie\n{ts:251} probably someone might ask himself what's the source and the motive behind this line? So where did this rumor come\n{ts:256} from? Now now let's let's be honest here. This we definitely know that this is the work of um money lovers,... {ts:265} attention seekers, people hungry for views, um clicks and online traffic. Um they know the name of the prophet draws\n{ts:276} attention. So they attempt to drag it into lies to boost their platforms. They're very sad\n{ts:284} to drag the name of the servant of the lord into their lies just so so that they may just boost the traffic. You\n{ts:292} know they don't even have the the evidence that the servant of the lord spoke said that others create fake\n{ts:298} headlines or posts just to sty controversies. It's about algorithms and you know ad revenue money. But how\n{ts:307} tragic, how tragic and how sad to use the fear of the end times to drive engagement.\n{ts:315} How sad to manipulate sacred matters for personal gain. How sad. The Bible warns in the book of Galatians 6:7 that do not\n{ts:325} be deceived. God is not mocked. Whatever a man sws that will also reap. He will also reap that. And actually the the the\n{ts:336} ministry official pages um for example on Facebook has come out to to really set the record straight that there is... {ts:344} nothing like that that the servant of the Lord had ever said. Now this is not a game. These are people's soul that\n{ts:353} someone is busy playing with. You know to those pushing this lie. My address will be just please repent.\n{ts:361} you know uh and try to use the chance the time that you have to turn back to God because you know every idle word\n{ts:370} will be brought into judgment every idol word will be brought into judgment that day and that day is very very coming. So\n{ts:377} let's set the the the record straight. Let's set the record straight that um here is what the prophet has actually\n{ts:383} stood for and has actually said over and over again. There is a day that is coming\n{ts:393} and that day when it arrives it will change the earth total totally.\n{ts:407} It will be irretrievable, irreversible, irrevable. [Music]\n{ts:421} He's saying that there is a day that is coming\n{ts:430} when the Lord as we are going to see now in the scripture\n{ts:436} when the Lord himself will come down to take the church. We are going to see in the scripture... {ts:443} just now. Now this is a message probably to us those\n{ts:451} who are believers are Christians. How should we respond then? Number one, we don't need to share rumors. We don't\n{ts:459} need to forward lies. Don't be part of spreading and and spreading confusion. You know, if it doesn't match the\n{ts:466} scripture or the voice of the Lord's true servant, reject it. Reject it. We have to stand, you know,\n{ts:475} we have to uh to to to to speak the truth. If someone tells you that the prophet has said that the world is\n{ts:482} ending on a particular day, we have to be firm and respond, you know, gently but firm and debunk this\n{ts:491} this lies, you know. Now, we need to focus on our personal preparation. The issue is not the date. Actually, the\n{ts:498} issue is your soul. Are you ready? That's the should be the question. Are you ready? Uh today, for\n{ts:506} example, if the Lord were to come, are you ready? We know you devil, the devil has been... {ts:513} using the same same tactics to dissuade people and to lie to many people and busy leading them to hell. The enemy\n{ts:520} knows that his time is short, very short. and uh and and and and that's why you know lies you know uh lies like this\n{ts:530} are being spread uh and manufactured people hellbent to create lies lies like this to taint the name of the\n{ts:542} ministry of the Lord you know they're busy mocking God's word you know discrediting every word that is in the\n{ts:550} Bible and try to distract the church That is the goal. They're trying to distract the church. But let me say\n{ts:556} again, God cannot be mocked. The Lord will defend his own word. [Music]\n{ts:574} [Music]",

                "snippet": "The story broke while Donald Trump's presidential campaign was in full swing, and journalist Rob Crilly noted that at that time he \"has had more weighty facts to clarify, such as his claim that Muslims in New Jersey cheered on the day of the 9/11 attacks – an old rumour that has long been discredited – and his latest boast, that he watched people jumping to their deaths from the Twin Towers from his Manhattan flat, four miles [6 km] away\". According to Jack Holmes of *Esquire* magazine, the ahistorical marker is symptomatic of the Trump administration; Jack Holmes points at other historical blunders made by members of the Trump administration, including Kellyanne Conway's reference to the non-existent Bowling Green massacre and Sean Spicer's claim that even Hitler had not used chemical weapons in conventional warfare, although Zyklon-B was used to exterminate prisoners in the Holocaust.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed he is an 18-time club championship winner at several clubs, none of which can be positively confirmed, and 16 of which were not official or all-member club championships. All these wins have been recorded at golf clubs owned or managed by The Trump Organization. Professional and amateur golfers, such as Buddy Marucci, have claimed that Trump would threaten to revoke the membership of anyone who won against him, thus allowing him to win club championships with little competition. Trump has claimed to have won the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach Club Championship in 1999, before the club was officially opened to membership, and the 2023 Senior Club Championship at the same course, despite not being present for the first day.... Trump at Naval Station Norfolk Pier 14, Norfolk, VirginiaOctober 5, 2025\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump falsely claimed to have predicted the attacks in his 2000 book *The America We Deserve* (ghostwritten by Dave Shiflett), that Osama bin Laden was not well known when the book was published, and that it called for the U.S. to \"take him out\". The book does contain two separate passages that mention bin Laden (who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list since June 7, 1999) and suggest an incident worse than the 1993 World Trade Center bombing may occur, but it does not call for the preemptive killing of bin Laden nor suggest he would be the one to orchestrate such an event if not killed. The ghostwriter, Shiflett, has called *The America We Deserve* \"[his] first work of fiction\".\n\nDuring his second presidency on October 5, 2025, Trump reiterated the falsehood at an event in Norfolk, Virginia celebrating the upcoming 250th anniversary of the US Navy's founding (October 13). Bringing up the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden under the Obama administration, Trump subsequently claimed to have warned his incumbent Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth of bin Laden's activity before the September 11th attacks in 2000 (or erroneously in 2024). In 2000, 19-year-old Hegseth enrolled at Princeton University, most likely never meeting Trump during his enrollment. Hegseth would not become the United States Secretary of Defense until January 25, 2025 at age 44, over two decades after the attack and less than ten months before Trump made this version of the false claim.... Trump claimed that his father had given him \"a small loan of a million dollars\", which he used to build \"a company that's worth more than $10 billion\", denying Marco Rubio's allegation that he had inherited $200 million. A 2018 *New York Times* exposé on Fred and Donald Trump's finances concludes that Donald \"was a millionaire by age 8\", and that he had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime, including over $60 million ($140 million in 2018 currency) in loans, which were largely unreimbursed.\n\nTrump claimed repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2015 that the actual unemployment rate of around 5% \"isn't reflective [of reality] ... I've seen numbers of 24%, I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment\". PolitiFact rated this claim \"Pants on Fire\", its rating for the most egregious falsehoods. Jeremy Adam Smith, writing for the *Greater Good Magazine*, said Trump's falsehoods may be \"blue lies\", which are \"told on behalf of a group, that can actually strengthen the bonds among the members of that group\". As a result, he posited, Trump's dishonesty does not lose the support of his political base, even while it \"infuriates and confuses almost everyone else\".... By October 9, 2019, *The Washington Post*'s fact-checking team documented that Trump had \"made 13,435 false or misleading claims over 993 days\". On October 18, 2019, the *Washington Post* Fact Checker newsletter described the situation:\n\nA thousand days of Trump. We often hear from readers wondering how President Trump's penchant for falsehoods stacks up in comparison to previous presidents. But there is no comparison: Trump exists in a league of his own. Deception, misdirection, gaslighting, revisionism, absurd boasts, and in some cases, provable lies, are core to his politics.\n\nAfter departing the White House, January 20, 2021, Trump gave a farewell address at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland prior to departing on Air Force One for his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. The AP fact-checked his speech, and reported that it included false statements about his presidency and administration's accomplishments. These included statements that he passed the largest tax cuts in history; that the U.S. economy during his tenure was the greatest in U.S. history; that he achieved record job creation; that his administration rebuilt both the U.S. military and the American manufacturing industry; that he destroyed the ISIS caliphate; and a reiteration of his previously repeated falsehood that he, and not former President Barack Obama, had passed the Veterans Choice Act. These falsehoods added to the 30,573 falsehoods that *The Washington Post*'s fact-checker had tallied by the end of Trump's presidency, an average of 21 falsehoods a day.\n\nScholarly analysis of Trump's tweets found \"significant evidence\" of an intent to deceive:\n\nAnalyzing Trump's tweets with a regression function designed to predict true and false claims based on their language and composition, it finds significant evidence of intent underlying most of Trump's false claims, and makes the case for calling them lies when that outcome agrees with the results of traditional fact-checking procedures.... We argue, based on our findings here, that intent to deceive is a reasonable inference from most of Trump's false tweets, and that drawing that conclusion when the evidence warrants could help scholars and journalists alike better explain the strategic functions of political falsehoods.... ### Commentary and analysis\n\nAs president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks. Trump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office according to *The New York Times*, and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of *The Washington Post*. By the *Post*'s tally, it took Trump 601 days to reach 5,000 false or misleading statements and another 226 days to reach the 10,000 mark. For the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections, it rose to an average of 30 per day from 4.9 during his first 100 days in office. The *Post* found that Trump averaged 15 false statements per day during 2018.\n\nThe *New York Times* editorial board frequently lambasted Trump's dishonesty. In September 2018, the board called him \"a president with no clear relation to the truth\". The following month, the board published an opinion piece titled, \"Donald Trump Is Lyin' Up a Storm\".\n\nJames Comey had frequent discussions with Trump, and in his first major interview after his firing he described Trump as a serial liar who tells \"baffling, unnecessary\" falsehoods:... #### Denial of collusion with Russia\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed he and his campaign did not collude with Russia, and Republicans and many otherwise reliable sources have repeated that false claim even though Mueller said that he did not investigate \"collusion\", only \"conspiracy\" and \"coordination\". The claim that there was no collusion has been described as a myth.\n\nIn a January 2019 interview, Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani undermined Trump's claim when he \"claimed Wednesday night that he 'never said there was no collusion' between President Trump's campaign and Russia leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\nGiuliani: [complained about] 'false reporting' on the Russia investigation.Cuomo: 'Mr. Mayor, false reporting is saying that nobody in the campaign had any contacts with Russia. False reporting is saying that there has been no suggestion of any kind of collusion between the campaign and any Russians.'Giuliani: 'You just misstated my position. I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign.'Cuomo: 'Yes, you have.'\n\nAfter his comments, Giuliani made statements that NPR described as an \"apparent reversal\" from his TV interview: He said \"'there was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form' and that he had 'no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign'.\"\n\nThe investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal \"conspiracy\".",

False reporting is saying that there has been no suggestion of any kind of collusion between the campaign and any Russians.'Giuliani: 'You just misstated my position. I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign.'Cuomo: 'Yes, you have.'\n\nAfter his comments, Giuliani made statements that NPR described as an \"apparent reversal\" from his TV interview: He said \"'there was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form' and that he had 'no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign'.\"\n\nThe investigation found there were at least 140 contacts between Trump or 18 of his associates with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries, though the contacts were insufficient to show an illegal \"conspiracy\".... #### Hurricane Dorian\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian approached the Atlantic coast in August 2019, Trump presented himself as closely monitoring the situation, tweeting extensively as *The New York Times* reported he was \"assuming the role of meteorologist in chief\". On September 1, Trump tweeted that Alabama, among other states, \"will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\". By that time, no forecaster was predicting Dorian would impact Alabama and the eight National Hurricane Center forecast updates over the preceding 24 hours showed Dorian steering well away from Alabama and moving up the coast. The Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) contradicted Trump 20 minutes later, tweeting that Alabama \"will NOT see any impacts from Dorian.\" After ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl reported the correction, Trump tweeted it was \"Such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl\".\n\nOn September 4, in the Oval Office, Trump displayed a modified version of an August 29 diagram by the National Hurricane Center of the projected track of Dorian. The modification was done with a black marker and extended the cone of uncertainty of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama. Modifying government weather forecasts is illegal in the U.S. Trump was known to use a Sharpie to write on documents, as well as speech notes and on the campaign trail. A White House official told *The Washington Post* Trump had altered the diagram with a Sharpie marker. Trump said he did not know how the map came to be modified and defended his claims, saying he had \"a better map\" with models that \"in all cases [showed] Alabama was hit\". Later on September 4, Trump tweeted a map by the South Florida Water Management District dated August 28 showing numerous projected paths of Dorian; Trump falsely asserted \"almost all models\" showed Dorian approaching Alabama. A note on the map stated it was \"superseded\" by National Hurricane Center publications and that it was to be discarded if there were any discrepancies.... On September 5, after Fox News correspondent John Roberts reported about the story, Trump summoned him to the Oval Office. Roberts later characterized Trump as \"just looking for acknowledgment that he was not wrong for saying that at some point, Alabama was at risk—even if the situation had changed by the time he issued the tweet\". Trump's Homeland Security Advisor Peter Brown issued a statement asserting Trump had been provided a graphic on September 1 showing tropical storm force winds touching the southeastern corner of Alabama; a White House source told CNN that Trump had personally instructed Brown to issue the statement.\n\nOn September 6, at Trump's direction, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to order acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs to fix the contradiction by Birmingham NWS, and Ross threatened to fire top NOAA officials if he did not. NOAA then tweeted a statement by an unnamed spokesman disavowing the Birmingham NWS tweet, asserting \"the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama,\" adding that the Birmingham tweet \"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time\". The president of the NWS Employees Organization responded, \"the hard-working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight\". Former senior NOAA executives were sharply critical. That evening, Trump tweeted a video of a CNN hurricane forecast from the Wednesday before his Sunday tweet in which the forecaster mentioned Alabama could be affected by Dorian—with the video altered to show \"Alabama\" being repeated several times; the video ended with a CNN logo careening off a road and bursting into flames. Trump continued to insist he was correct through September 7, asserting \"The Fake News Media was fixated\" and tweeting forecast maps from at least two days before his original Sunday tweet, as the media dubbed the episode \"Sharpiegate\". Commentators expressed bafflement that Trump chose to insist he was correct about what might otherwise have passed as a minor gaffe.\n\nOn September 9, NWS director Louis Uccellini said the Birmingham NWS had not tweeted in response to Trump's tweet, but in response to phone calls and social media contacts they had received in response to Trump's tweet. \"Only later, when the retweets and politically based comments started coming to their office, did they learn the sources of this information,\" he said.",

Misinformation can cause widespread societal harm. For example, we have seen how \nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories resulted in resistance to government-recommended safety protocols \n[6,7]\nsuch as mask-wearing and vaccination . In this handbook, we will focus on debunking climate change \nmisinformation through psychological inoculation, so named for its parallels to the process of \nbiological inoculation. Psychological inoculation is a process of exposing people to examples of \nmisinformation techniques, including refutations of the misinformation, so that they build “cognitive \nantibodies,” enabling them to spot and resist misinformation in the future. Psychological inoculation \n[14]\nhas proven effective across a number of topics, including climate change .\nHuman-induced climate change is causing changes to our weather, our ecosystems, our infrastructure, \nand our health, most of which are having adverse consequences.

Climate Myth Debunking for \nBroadcast Meteorologists\n05\nBreaking the Climate Silence\nResearch has shown that many people choose not to talk about climate change—and other issues\n—because they fear judgment or pushback from others. This comes from a phenomenon known as \npluralistic ignorance—the tendency for people to misperceive others' opinions, thinking that they are in a \nminority when in reality, most others hold the same opinions\n[8]. This has been a barrier in the past that \nprevented broadcast meteorologists from discussing climate change on air. However, a majority (62%) \nof broadcast meteorologists who share climate-change-related information with their audiences \nreceive mostly positive responses from their audience\n[21].\nWhile the fear of being disliked or losing respect of the audience after discussing climate change is \ncertainly understandable, broadcast meteorologists can rest assured that 70% of Americans believe \nclimate change is happening, and will appreciate hearing about climate change from broadcasters\n[8, 21, 10, 11].\nHow to Structure a Debunking\nAn effective debunking should aim to incorporate the following elements, following the Fact-Myth-\nFallacy-Fact structure\n[13]:\n\nClimate Myth Debunking for \nBroadcast Meteorologists\n06\nClimate change is \ncaused by the sun\n“\n“\nFact-Myth-Fallacy-Fact Example...

It was correct at the time of writing. Our latest fact checks about Covid-19 and the pandemic can be found here.*\n\nA video on Instagram that has been viewed more than 20,000 times claims that a second wave of Covid-19 has been planned, and Covid-19 vaccines are going to be fatal.\n\nBoth claims are false.\n\nConspiracy theories about the planning of Covid-19 have been shared widely on social media before. These include claims that Full Fact has already debunked, including that Event 201 (a pandemic response planning exercise) was a “rehearsal” for the coronavirus pandemic, that the virus was man-made and that Bill Gates owns the vaccine for or patent of Covid-19.\n\nThere is no evidence that the creation or spread of Covid-19 has at any point been orchestrated by political, commercial or other organisations/institutions.... In any case, a “second-wave” of Covid-19 cases has already happened (at least in the UK) and political leaders have begun warning of a third wave rise in cases.\n\nWe have also repeatedly debunked claims that Covid-19 vaccines are deadly. Analysis by the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) did not suggest that fatalities of early recipients were caused by the vaccine. It also found the none of the serious adverse reactions reported appear to have been caused by the vaccine.\n\nMore recent data on the Yellow Card scheme (the UK system for collecting and monitoring information on safety concerns such as suspected side effects or adverse incidents involving medicines and medical devices) shows that despite many millions of vaccine doses administered no new safety concerns have been reported. The MHRA also notes that of the “medical conditions reported in temporal association with vaccination, the available evidence does not currently suggest that the vaccine caused the event.”\n\n**Update 16 August 2021**\n\nA line was added at the beginning of this article to reflect new information about vaccine safety, which appeared after it was published.\n\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

                "snippet": "Abraham Lincoln did not have social media in his time. If he did, I honestly believe he might have reconsidered his final observation that \"you cannot fool all the people all the time.\" There have been a few stories in recent years that have made their way through cyberspace that have been pretty much off the wall … so much so, you would think that very few, if any, people would be fooled.\n\nBut in reality, a surprisingly large number of people took them at face value, believing they were true.\n\nThe most famous, of course, is the annual \"Mars Hoax,\" which rears its ugly head every August. Ever since a historically close approach of the Red Planet to Earth occurred in August 2003, a spurious Internet story has circulated every year since, which implies that on a specific night in late August, Mars will loom in the sky as the same size as the full moon. Totally untrue, of course, yet every year there are countless people who actually believe it will happen.\n\nThen earlier this year, a widely shared story on the Web claimed that Jan. 4 was \"Zero Gravity Day,\" a date when people on Earth would supposedly be able to experienceweightlessness if they jumped into the air at a specific moment that day. One has to wonder just how many people worldwide actually tried to float on that day.... And now, are you ready for this? Sunday (Nov. 15), the Earth supposedly will be plunged into darkness for 15 days, all thanks to a \"rare phenomenon\" caused by the movement of Venus and Jupiter. [10 Alien Encounter Claims Debunked]\n\nOf course, like the Mars story and Zero Gravity Day, this supposed worldwide blackout is false. And yet, the Internet is crackling with all sorts of reports on what to expect.\n\n**A fake news space meme**\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\n\nA fake news site — \"Newswatch 33\" — is apparently the reference source for this bogus report. The Earth, the report says, will go dark Nov. 15, just before 3 a.m. (no clue if this is Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific Standard or any other time). Then, after 15 days, the eerie darkness will finally lift on Nov. 30, at 4:45 p.m.\n\nPresident Barack Obama purportedly has been briefed about the upcoming phenomenon in a 1,000-page memorandum from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.\n\nThe reason given for the blackout? The recent close conjunction of Venus and Jupiterin the predawn morning sky of Oct. 26. Venus, always the brightest planet, came so close to Jupiter as seen from here on Earth that its dazzling light heated the Jovian atmosphere.... Of course, the two planets were actually separated in space by 535 million miles (860 million kilometers); the fake news story somehow manages to overlook that important point. [See photos of Venus and Jupiter in the Night Sky]\n\nJupiter's reaction to Venus' \"close approach\" was to supposedly release a huge amount of hydrogen into its atmosphere, which in turn was apparently ejected into space and Sunday will induce a massive explosion on the sun.\n\nWait … it gets better.\n\nThe story continues to claim that the sun will then react to the outburst by attempting to cool itself down and in the process,\n\n*will then turn blue* as a result.\n\nAnd that's when everything on this planet of ours is supposed to go dark.\n\nThe apocryphal details go on to claim that Bolden doesn't think the Earth will experience any major issues during the blackout: \"This event will be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter,\" Bolden supposedly says. \"The only other effect it will have is everyone will get to have a true Black Friday after Thanksgiving.\"\n\nThere's even a hashtag — #NovemberBlackOut — where people can tweet what they are going to do during the days of darkness.\n\n**A cosmic case of nonsense**\n\nAll of this is complete and utter nonsense, of course! The sun will continue shining through Thanksgiving, just as it does every year.... Moreover, the \"15 days of darkness\" hoax was has been circulated a few times before, most recently this past June.\n\nSnopes, the website that reports on the validity of rumors and urban legends, has also posted its own take on this fallacy: http://www.snopes.com/15-days-darkness-november/\n\nBottom line: Planet Earth will not go dark on Sunday … or at any time in the near (or distant) future. Any email or social media claims to the contrary are completely bogus.\n\nDon’t keep your family and friends \"in the dark\" (pun firmly intended) and spread the word.\n\n*Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New York's Hayden Planetarium.

The footage matches earlier reports and was even covered by the Ukrainian news outlet 24 Kanal, which published the story under the headline “Lviv Covered by Unique Thundercloud: Amazing Video”. Thus, the viral claim linking the phenomenon to a recent event in India is false.\n\n### Claim:\n\nA viral video circulating on social media claims to show a massive cloud formation over Gurugram, Haryana, and the Delhi NCR region on 3rd September 2025. The cloud appears to be a cumulonimbus formation, which is typically associated with heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and severe weather conditions.\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nAfter conducting a reverse image search on key frames of the viral video, we found matching visuals from videos that attribute the phenomenon to Lviv, a city in Ukraine. These videos date back to August 2021, thereby debunking the claim that the footage depicts a recent weather event over Gurugram, Haryana, or the Delhi NCR region.\n\nFurther research revealed that a Ukrainian news channel named 24 Kanal, had reported on the Lviv thundercloud phenomenon in August 2021. The report was published under the headline “Lviv Covered by Unique Thundercloud: Amazing Video” ( original in Russian, translated into English).... ###\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe viral video does not depict a recent weather event in Gurugram or Delhi NCR, but rather an old incident from Lviv, Ukraine, recorded in August 2021.

Additionally, analysis using Hiya AI Audio identified voice manipulation, flagging the segment as a deepfake with an authenticity score of 1/100. The fabricated statement was: “never mess with Pakistan because their army appears to be far more superior.” Thus, the viral video is doctored and misleading.... ###\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, we located the full version of the video on the official YouTube channel of the Press Information Bureau (PIB), published on 11 May 2025. In this video, at the 59:57-minute mark, the Vice Admiral can be heard saying:\n\n“This time if Pakistan dares take any action, and Pakistan knows it, what we are going to do. That’s all.”\n\nFurther analysis was conducted using the Hive Moderation tool to examine the authenticity of the circulating clip. The results indicated that the video had been artificially generated, with clear signs of AI manipulation. This suggests that the content was not genuine but rather created with the intent to mislead viewers and spread misinformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n###\n\nThe viral video attributing remarks to Vice Admiral AN Pramod about India seeking U.S. and President Trump’s intervention against Pakistan is misleading. The extended speech, available on the Press Information Bureau’s official YouTube channel, contained no such statement. Instead of the alleged claim, the Vice Admiral concluded his comments by saying, “That’s all.” AI analysis using Hive Moderation further indicated that the viral clip had been artificially manipulated, with fabricated audio inserted to misrepresent his words. These findings confirm that the video is altered and does not reflect the Vice Admiral’s actual remarks.\n\nClaim: Fake Viral Video Claiming Vice Admiral AN Pramod saying that next time if Pakistan Attack we will complain to US and Prez Trump.\n\nClaimed On: Social Media\n\nFact Check: False and Misleading... ### Executive Summary:\n\n###\n\nA video circulating on social media falsely claims to show Indian Air Chief Marshal AP Singh admitting that India lost six jets and a Heron drone during Operation Sindoor in May 2025. It has been revealed that the footage had been digitally manipulated by inserting an AI generated voice clone of Air Chief Marshal Singh into his recent speech, which was streamed live on August 9, 2025.\n\n**Claim:**\n\nA viral video (archived video) (another link) shared by an X user stating in the caption “ Breaking: Finally Indian Airforce Chief admits India did lose 6 Jets and one Heron UAV during May 7th Air engagements.” which is actually showing the Air Chief Marshal has admitted the aforementioned loss during Operation Sindoor.\n\n### Fact Check:\n\nBy conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, we found a clip which was posted by ANI Official X handle , after watching the full clip we didn't find any mention of the aforementioned alleged claim.\n\nOn further research we found an extended version of the video in the Official YouTube Channel of ANI which was published on 9th August 2025. At the 16th Air Chief Marshal L.M. Katre Memorial Lecture in Marathahalli, Bengaluru, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh did not mention any loss of six jets or a drone in relation to the conflict with Pakistan. The discrepancies observed in the viral clip suggest that portions of the audio may have been digitally manipulated.\n\nThe audio in the viral video, particularly the segment at the 29:05 minute mark alleging the loss of six Indian jets, appeared to be manipulated and displayed noticeable inconsistencies in tone and clarity.... ### Conclusion:\n\nThe viral video claiming that Air Chief Marshal AP Singh admitted to the loss of six jets and a Heron UAV during Operation Sindoor is misleading. A reverse image search traced the footage that no such remarks were made. Further an extended version on ANI’s official YouTube channel confirmed that, during the 16th Air Chief Marshal L.M. Katre Memorial Lecture, no reference was made to the alleged losses. Additionally, the viral video’s audio, particularly around the 29:05 mark, showed signs of manipulation with noticeable inconsistencies in tone and clarity.\n\n- Claim: Viral Video Claiming IAF Chief Acknowledged Loss of Jets Found Manipulated\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n****\n\nA viral video (archive link) claims General Upendra Dwivedi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), admitted to losing six Air Force jets and 250 soldiers during clashes with Pakistan. Verification revealed the footage is from an IIT Madras speech, with no such statement made. AI detection confirmed parts of the audio were artificially generated.\n\n**** **Claim:**\n\n****... The claim in question is that General Upendra Dwivedi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), admitted to losing six Indian Air Force jets and 250 soldiers during recent clashes with Pakistan.\n\n**** **Fact Check:**\n\nUpon conducting a reverse image search on key frames from the video, it was found that the original footage is from IIT Madras, where the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) was delivering a speech. The video is available on the official YouTube channel of ADGPI – Indian Army, published on 9 August 2025, with the description:\n\n*“Watch COAS address the faculty and students on ‘Operation Sindoor – A New Chapter in India’s Fight Against Terrorism,’ highlighting it as a calibrated, intelligence-led operation reflecting a doctrinal shift. On the occasion, he also focused on the major strides made in technology absorption and capability development by the Indian Army, while urging young minds to strive for excellence in their future endeavours.”*\n\nA review of the full speech revealed no reference to the destruction of six jets or the loss of 250 Army personnel. This indicates that the circulating claim is not supported by the original source and may contribute to the spread of misinformation.\n\nFurther using AI Detection tools like Hive Moderation we found that the voice is AI generated in between the lines.... **** **Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim is baseless. The video is a manipulated creation that combines genuine footage of General Dwivedi’s IIT Madras address with AI-generated audio to fabricate a false narrative. No credible source corroborates the alleged military losses.\n\n- Claim: AI-Generated Audio Falsely Claims COAS Admitted to Loss of 6 Jets and 250 Soldiers\n\n- Claimed On: Social Media\n\n- Fact Check: False and Misleading\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nAs we researched a viral social media video we encountered, we did a comprehensive fact check utilizing reverse image search. The video circulated with the claim that it shows illegal Bangladeshi in Assam's Goalpara district carrying homemade spears and attacking a police and/or government official. Our findings are certain that this claim is false. This video was filmed in the Kishoreganj district, Bangladesh, on July 1, 2025, during a political argument involving two rival factions of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The footage has been intentionally misrepresented, putting the report into context regarding Assam to disseminate false information.\n\n**Claim:**\n\nThe viral video shows illegal Bangladeshi immigrants armed with spears marching in Goalpara, Assam, with the intention of attacking police or officials.... Claim: Video shows illegal migrants with spears moving in groups to assault police!\n\nClaimed On: Social Media\n\nFact Check: False and Misleading",

The digitally manipulated video is part of a Pakistani propaganda campaign, and the PIB has urged people to rely on verified sources and report suspicious content.\n\nEver since the Indian Armed Forces targeted terrorist establishments in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under Operation Sindoor to avenge the death of 26 people in the Pahalgam terrorist attack, fake posts about the Indian Army have been circulating on social media. One such post by Pakistani propaganda accounts falsely shows a digitally altered video of Western Command Chief Lt Gen Manoj Kumar Katiyar, claiming that payments were made to the Afghan Taliban to act against Pakistan. The post further alleged that the Taliban accepted the money and are now fighting for India against Pakistan.\n\n**PIB debunks fake video**\n\nThe Press Information Bureau (PIB) has firmly debunked the misinformation, stating, \"Western Command Chief Lt. Gen. Manoj Kumar Katiyar has NOT given any such statement!\" The PIB clarified that these AI-manipulated videos are part of a propaganda campaign aimed at misleading the public and creating panic. The bureau also shared a YouTube link to the genuine, unedited video for public verification, urging people to rely only on authentic sources.... **How to report fake content**\n\nThe PIB added, \"If you spot such content, please report it to us on 8799711259 and mail at factcheck@pib.gov.in. .\" Authorities have also urged public vigilance to prevent the spread of misleading information.\n\n**India-Pakistan conflict**\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces launched a massive operation against terror groups in Pakistan and PoK in retaliation to the Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 innocent people. India launched ardent and precise strikes under Operation Sindoor, destroying over nine terror camps. These locations were key command centres of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), responsible for major attacks like Pulwama (2019) and Mumbai (2008). More than 100 terrorists were killed in the attack.\n\nIn retaliation, Pakistan attempted strikes on Indian military bases over the next three days - May 8, 9, and 10. Reacting to this, India launched missile and drone attacks, targeting key military establishments of Pakistan. After four days of intense cross-border drone and missile exchanges, Pakistan reached out to India and requested for a ceasefire.\n\n**ALSO READ: Fact check: PIB debunks fake video of Trump discussing India-Pakistan conflict, shares original clip**",

Fine urban particulate levels owing to limited dispersion from light daytime winds and limited morning vertical mixing over portions of far West Texas are expected to occasionally raise PM2.5/PM10 levels to the \"Moderate\" range, however the overall daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs are forecast to net out in the \"Good\" range for the majority of the region, which includes the El Paso area.\n\nLight winds, warm temperatures, sufficient afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels could be enough for ozone to reach the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Houston, Midland-Odessa, and San Antonio areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Amarillo, Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-McAllen, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, Laredo, Lubbock, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.\n\nA large portion of the light density residual smoke attributed to the scattered prescribed burning activities across parts of the Mississippi River Valley and East Texas is forecast to begin exiting the state as a cold front moves over West Texas, the Texas Panhandle, the Permian Basin, and North Central Texas. While some of the smoke combined with slightly elevated light density urban fine particulate aerosols associated with light morning winds or slightly elevated relative humidity levels over the eastern two-thirds of Texas may raise PM2.5 levels to the \"Moderate\" range at times, the overall daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to net out in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Brownsville-McAllen and Houston areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, Laredo, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.... Light winds, warm temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels could be enough for ozone to reach the upper end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas; the middle of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin and San Antonio areas; the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Bryan-College Station, Midland-Odessa, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas; and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Laredo, and Victoria areas.\n\nDepending on the amount of prescribed burning activities across parts of the Mississippi River Valley and East Texas, light density residual smoke may begin to expand over portions of East and Southeast Texas, slightly raising fine particulate levels. Meanwhile, another cold front is forecast to move through far West Texas, the Texas Panhandle, the Permian Basin, and a portion of North Central Texas. The light density residual smoke combined with slightly elevated urban fine particulate aerosols, mainly over South Central, North Central, Northeast, and Southeast Texas, converging along and ahead of the leading edge of the cold frontal boundary, may result in slightly increased PM2.5 levels as the front approaches. The overall daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to rise to the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas and to the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-McAllen, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, and Victoria areas.... Slightly elevated urban fine particulate background levels over portions of far West Texas associated with light daytime winds and limited morning vertical mixing could raise the daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs to the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area.\n\nLight winds, warm temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels could be enough for ozone to reach the middle of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio areas; the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Tyler-Longview and Waco-Killeen areas; and the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Laredo, Midland-Odessa, and Victoria areas.\n\nDepending on the movement and position of the aforementioned cold front, potential light density residual smoke attributed to possible small prescribed burning activities across parts of the Mississippi River Valley and East Texas filtering over East and Southeast Texas, combined with slightly elevated urban fine particulate aerosols over portions of South Central, North Central, Northeast, and Southeast Texas attributed to light morning winds, and slightly elevated urban fine particulate aerosols over portions of deep South Texas, the Coastal Plains, and Southeast Texas attributed to slightly elevated relative humidity levels may periodically raise the PM2.5 AQI to the \"Moderate\" range. Overall, the daily PM2.5 AQI may remain in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Brownsville-McAllen and Houston areas and should net out in the upper end of the \"Good\" range for the majority of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas.... Slightly elevated urban fine particulate background levels over portions of far West Texas associated with light daytime winds and limited morning vertical mixing could maintain the daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs at the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area.\n\nThis forecast was last updated at 11:15 AM on Friday, October 17th, and is updated daily on normal TCEQ workdays and may also be updated on weekends or holidays when air pollution levels are high.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... The large crater J. Herschel spans 96 miles and betrays its age in two ways. First, the poor rim has been long battered down by smaller impacts and has so many dents that the low-angle sunlight easily streams into the middle. And second, what would have been a complex jumble of central peaks lies buried under the immense amount of rubble thrown out by the giant impact that carved out the Imbrium basin. It looks like someone has kicked dirt on a key lime pie.\nCloser to the pole, the 44-mile-wide Philolaus has much younger features, most notably a sharp and tall rim that casts a long, dark shadow. Return for the next night or two to see its twin central peaks. Herschel may be unrecognizable by now. (Philolaus was a 5th-century Greek who followed Pythagoras and said that Earth was moving. John Herschel charted the southern sky.)\nYou can try again on Nov. 1st, with lighting 10 hours later than pictured here.\nMeteor Watch: Perfect conditions\nThe Orionid meteor shower peaks Oct. 21, although it is active between Oct. 2 and Nov. 7. This annual event is renowned for its swift, bright meteors that radiate from the constellation Orion, near the star Betelgeuse. Under optimal conditions — clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution — viewers can expect up to 20 meteors per hour in the predawn hours when the radiant is high in the sky. The radiant rises in the east before midnight and reaches its highest point in the sky around 5:30 a.m., making the early-morning hours ideal for observation. This year the New Moon on Oct. 21 ensures dark skies, enhancing visibility. To fully appreciate the spectacle, find a dark location, lie back, and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness.... Did a nova just appear below Saturn? Peaking up to 2nd magnitude, the larger geostationary satellites reflect sunlight from their solar panels. Lower satellites move across the sky, but for these big birds, the sky moves slowly past them. The time of peak brightness shifts about four minutes earlier each night.\nCeres spends all month within a short distance of several bright stars, aiding in its identification.

Moonlight will not interfere with observing. It is very close to a new Moon, so the Moon isn’t up for most observers for almost all of the night, and either dark or just the thinnest of crescents shortly before dawn.

                "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude.

It is defined as the closest Full Moon to autumnal (fall) equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAs well as being named after the harvest season in the northern half of the globe, the moonrise times around Full Moon at the autumnal equinox are favorable to getting in the harvest. This is because the difference in the time between moonrise from one night to the next becomes\n\n**less than the average of 50 minutes**. The result is that, for **several nights in a row, there’s extra moonlight in the evenings**. Historically, this gave farmers more time to harvest crops.\n\nThe opposite takes effect in the Southern Hemisphere around the September equinox with\n\n**more** than 50 minutes between moonrise from one day to the next around the Full Moon.... ## Two Meteor Showers in October\n\nMeteors, or shooting stars, are the bright streaks of light that occur when a meteoroid—a rock in space—hits our atmosphere and burns up. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid.\n\nOctober boasts two meteor showers: the\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaking around October 8–9, and the **Orionid meteor shower** peaking around October 20–21. The bad news is that the glare from the bright Full Moon will reduce the number of Draconids that are visible this year. The good news is that the Orionids peak close to New Moon, when the night sky is at its darkest.\n\nThe origin of the Draconids is the dust trail left by comet\n\n**21P/Giacobini-Zinner**. Meanwhile, the Orionids have a more famous parent body: **Halley’s Comet**. Have a look at our tips for watching meteor showers.\n\n## Coral Spawning Follows October Full Moon\n\nIn the days after Full Moon in October and November, corals in Australia’s\n\n**Great Barrier Reef** simultaneously release bundles of eggs and sperm into the sea. This phenomenon is called **coral spawning**.\n\nThe event only happens at night, and its timing hinges on a number of factors including Moon phase, water temperatures, salinity levels, and the length of day.\n\nIn the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the inshore reefs usually spawn in\n\n**October**; the outer reefs tend to spawn during **November** or **December**. Meanwhile at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Texas and Louisiana in the USA, coral spawning typically happens after the **August** Full Moon.... ## Mercury Makes a Bright Appearance\n\nMercury shines bright on October 29 as it reaches its\n\n**greatest elongation east**. In general, the days on either side of greatest elongations are the best time to catch the innermost planet in our solar system.\n\nBecause Mercury is small and lies close to the Sun, it can be a challenge to observe. But at greatest elongation east, there is a chance to see it with the naked eye soon after sunset.\n\nAnd the elusive Mercury tends to favor one or other of the hemispheres—this time stargazers in the\n\n**Southern Hemisphere** get the best view.\n\nThere will be a close approach of Mercury and Mars on\n\n**October 20**, seen here from Sydney, Australia, as the two planets set.\n\nAnd on\n\n**October 23**, the Waxing Crescent Moon will join Mercury and Mars—as seen here in Sydney at around 20:15 (8:15 pm) local time.\n\n**But beware:** Do not try to observe objects close to the Sun while any part of the Sun is above the horizon. Never point binoculars or a telescope in the direction of the Sun—it **can cause permanent eye damage**.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Which planets are in the night sky tonight?\n\nOur Interactive Night Sky Map gives the rise and set times for the planets in your town or city.... ## How many planets are there?\n\nAccording to the latest definition, there are 8 planets in our solar system.\n\n## How long does it take to get to Venus?\n\nA typical journey time is around four or five months.",

A Supermoon takes over, the Draconid meteor shower peeks through, and the Orionid meteors sparkle across the night sky.\nThe evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because - it's a supermoon!\nThis evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why?\nSupermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with \"perigee,\" which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month.\nSo this is an exceptionally close full moon! Which explains its spectacular appearance.\nAnd what timing - while the supermoon appears on October 6th, just a couple of days before on October 4th is \"International Observe the Moon Night\"!... It's an annual, worldwide event when Moon enthusiasts come together to enjoy our natural satellite.You can attend or host a moon-viewing party, or simply observe the Moon from wherever you are.\nSo look up, and celebrate the moon along with people all around the world!\nThe supermoon will light up the sky on October 6th, but if you luck into some dark sky between October 6th and 10th, you might witness the first of two October meteor showers - the Draconids!\nThe Draconid meteor shower comes from debris trailing the comet 21P Giacobini-Zinner burning up in Earth's atmosphere\nThese meteors originate from nearby the head of the constellation Draco the dragon in the northern sky and the shower can produce up to 10 meteors per hour!\nThe Draconids peak around October 8th, but if you don't see any, you can always blame the bright supermoon and wait a few weeks until the next meteor shower - the Orionids!\nThe Orionid meteor shower, peaking October 21, is set to put on a spectacular show, shooting about 20 meteors per hour across the night sky.\nThis meteor shower happens when Earth travels through the debris trailing behind Halley's Comet and it burns up in our atmosphere.... The full duration of the meteor shower stretches from September 26 to November 22, but your best bet to see meteors is on October 21 before midnight until around 2 am.\nThis is because, not only is this night the shower's peak, it is also the October new moon, meaning the moon will be between the Earth and the Sun, making it dark and invisible to us.\nWith a moonless sky, you're much more likely to catch a fireball careening through the night.\nSo find a dark location after the sun has set, look to the southeast sky (if you're in the northern hemisphere) and the northeast (if you're in the southern hemisphere) and enjoy!\nOrionid meteors appear to come from the direction of the Orion constellation but you might catch them all across the sky.\nHere are the phases of the Moon for October.\nYou can stay up to date on all of NASA's missions exploring the solar system and beyond at science.nasa.gov.",

                "snippet": "## Meteor Showers in Early and Late October\n\n### The Draconids – Dragon Meteors Under a Bright Moon\n\nThe\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaks around October 8, 2025, but this year the “Dragon” will have its fire stolen by moonlight. The Draconids are a minor shower (often only ~10 meteors per hour under dark skies [1]), and unfortunately a **full Moon on October 6–7** will flood the night sky with light during the peak [2]. The bright moonlight will wash out all but the brightest Draconid meteors, making them hard to spot. Best chance to catch a few “shooting stars” from Draco’s radiant (near the Dragon’s head in the northern sky) is *as soon as darkness falls* on October 8, before the Moon rises too high [3]. This unusual timing – evening instead of predawn – is because Draconid meteors fly in the early night hours (the shower’s radiant is highest in the sky at nightfall) [4].\n\nWhy bother with a faint shower? The Draconids are infamous for occasional\n\n**outbursts**. In rare years, if Earth passes through a dense clump of debris from the shower’s parent comet (21P/Giacobini-Zinner), the Draconids have surprised observers with hundreds or even thousands of meteors per hour (notably in 1933 and 1946) [5] [6]. Most years are quiet, but the comet did reach perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in March 2025, raising the *possibility* of enhanced activity [7] [8]. “Watch out if the Dragon awakes!” writes one skywatching columnist – that slim chance of a meteor storm keeps many enthusiasts outdoors **even in moonlight** during this shower [9]. While a storm is not expected, keep an eye on the northern sky on October 8–9 just in case. (The Draconids favor observers in the **Northern Hemisphere**; those far south won’t see much, as Draco sits low or below the horizon.)... ### The Orionids – Halley’s Comet’s Encore\n\nLater in the month comes the\n\n**Orionid meteor shower**, peaking on the night of October 21–22, 2025. The Orionids are debris from the famous **Halley’s Comet** and are known for fast, fine meteors. In a typical year, the Orionid shower produces about **20 meteors per hour at peak under clear dark skies** [10]. Some years have surged higher (50–70 per hour in exceptional displays), but recently Orionids have been modest, around 20–30 per hour [11]. Fortunately, conditions in 2025 will be *nearly ideal*: the peak falls under a **new Moon**, so **no moonlight will interfere** [12]. In fact, the Moon will be only ~2% illuminated and rises near dawn, essentially leaving the late-night sky perfectly dark [13] [14] for meteor spotting.\n\nThe best time to watch is\n\n**after midnight until pre-dawn** on Oct. 21/22, once the constellation Orion (the shower’s radiant near Orion’s Club) climbs high. Orionids are swift – striking Earth almost head-on at 66 km/s – which often yields long, quick streaks [15]. They can appear anywhere in the sky, so find a dark location, lie back, and scan around Orion and the neighboring constellations. This shower is visible from both the **Northern and Southern Hemispheres**, as Orion straddles the celestial equator [16] [17]. NASA notes that the Orionids’ parent, Halley’s Comet, also causes the Eta Aquariids in May – making Halley “a two-for-one deal” for meteor fans each year [18]. With no Moon to spoil the show in 2025, **experts predict excellent viewing conditions**, so this could be one of the top meteor showers of the year [19].... ## Planetary Highlights and Conjunctions\n\nOctober 2025 offers plenty of planet spotting opportunities. Two bright planets,... **at peak brilliance**in these weeks – astronomers rate it around magnitude –4.5, the brightest it gets all year [48] [49]. **Tip:**after observing Venus and the Moon, scan higher up for fainter **Mars**(see below) and toward the west for Jupiter setting at dawn. **Mercury and Mars at Dusk:**Fleet-footed **Mercury**makes a challenging appearance in late October. On **October 29**, Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation, 23° away from the Sun in the evening sky [50]. This is actually Mercury’s *last*evening apparition of 2025, but it’s not particularly favorable for those in the Northern Hemisphere. Even at maximum separation, Mercury will be low in the bright twilight (it sets shortly after the Sun). Still, around the final week of October, persistent observers might catch Mercury as a faint “star” very low on the **west-southwest horizon**about 30–45 minutes after sunset [51]. Binoculars will help you spot it in the glow. (Observers in the Southern Hemisphere get a slightly better viewing angle, so Mercury will be a bit higher for them.) Intriguingly, **Mars**is also lurking in the same area of sky. Mars, now on the far side of the Sun and very faint, has been sinking into the sunset glare each evening. Around **October 19–23**, Mercury and Mars actually pass each other in what would be a *conjunction*– but this happens so deep in twilight that it’s a tough observation. Mercury is emerging upward from solar conjunction while Mars is vanishing downward into it, so they are both extremely low after sunset [52]. High Point Scientific notes this pairing gives a brief opportunity to see the two planets close together as they trade places relative to the Sun [53]. If you have a **very clear view of the western horizon**on Oct. 19–20, you might attempt a sighting: about 15–20 minutes after sunset, scan for Mercury (the brighter of the two) and see if you can also glimpse dim Mars nearby. Realistically, Mars will likely be invisible without a telescope. By early November, Mars is in conjunction with the Sun and gone. So think of this as **Mercury’s farewell to Mars**in the twilight – a symbolic handoff from one planet to the other.... ## Comets and Cosmic Visitors\n\nComet enthusiasts have much to be excited about in late 2025. October brings the potential for... *(Comet source refs: StarWalk/Starry Night guides [88] [89] [90]; NASA Science [91] [92]; Chron/EarthSky for context [93].)*... ## Auroras on the Rise – Eyes North (or South)!\n\nHigh-latitude skywatchers should stay alert this October for\n\n**aurora borealis** (Northern Lights) or aurora australis (Southern Lights). Solar activity is near its 11-year peak in 2025 – in fact, the Sun’s **solar maximum** is predicted for around July 2025 [94]. That means the Sun is freckled with sunspots and prone to eruptions like flares and coronal mass ejections, which send charged particles hurtling toward Earth. When those particles strike our atmosphere, they trigger the glowing curtains of auroras. The past year has already seen an uptick in auroral displays, and experts say 2025 will continue the trend [95] [96]. *“Aurora activity can often peak after solar maximum, meaning that the next couple of years will likely be an exciting time for aurora watchers,”* notes Dr. Renate Mauland-Hus, an astrophysicist interviewed by TimeandDate [97].\n\nOctober (along with the spring) is traditionally an excellent season for auroras because of the\n\n**equinox effect** – for reasons still being studied, geomagnetic disturbances seem to be more frequent around the equinoxes. With the **nights growing longer** in October, any geomagnetic storm has more hours of darkness to be observed. In practical terms, this means if the Sun belches out a strong Earth-directed solar flare or CME in September/October, auroras could potentially be visible farther from the poles than usual. Already in late 2024 and early 2025, auroras have been sighted at unusually low latitudes during big solar storms [98]. So if you live in **northern Europe, Canada, the northern U.S.** or similarly high latitudes (or the far southern hemisphere equivalents), keep an eye on space weather alerts. A good resource is NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center aurora forecasts or local observatory announcements.... With a little planning, October 2025 could be an unforgettable month of skywatching. From the eerie\n\n**Draconid meteors**under an autumn sky, to the crisp mornings with **Venus and the crescent Moon**, to the spectacle of a **Harvest supermoon**, there’s a bounty of cosmic wonders to enjoy. So bundle up, find a dark sky if you can, and **enjoy the show** – the universe is putting on one nightly above us.

Plus, don't miss the Orionid meteor shower.\nMercury (top) and Mars appear in a patch of clear sky near the top of this photo during their 2024 conjunction. This month brings another meeting of the two planets. Credit: Gianni Tumino\nKey Takeaways:\nOctober's longer nights bring two transits of Titan across Saturn, while Io and Europa tango together across Jupiter three times. Mercury and Mars make a brief evening appearance, and Venus dominates the morning sky. Plus, the fine Orionid meteor shower occurs during the dark of the Moon.\nMercury and Mars meet in the evening sky, although their low altitude means Northern Hemisphere observers will find them difficult to spot. They reach conjunction less than 2° apart on Oct. 19. Both set less than an hour after sunset.\nOn the 19th, look for magnitude –0.2 Mercury 4° high in the southwest 20 minutes after sunset. You might spot it with binoculars. Within 10 minutes it drops below 3° in altitude. From Mercury, scan 2° to the upper right to try spotting dimmer Mars at magnitude 1.5.... Oct. 19 brings a conjunction of Mars and Mercury, but be quick — they set within an hour of the Sun. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nMars is quickly heading toward solar conjunction. Mercury stands between the Red Planet and a crescent Moon Oct. 23. Mercury is 4.5° northwest of the Moon; they are very low in the southwest and set by 7 p.m. At about 6:40 p.m. local daylight time in North America, they stand 2° to 3° high. Can you also spot magnitude 1.1 Antares, 9° high and almost 13° east of the crescent Moon in the twilight?\nMercury reaches greatest eastern elongation Oct. 29, when it is 24° from the Sun. Its low declination limits its visibility after sunset. By Oct. 30 Mercury has crossed into Scorpius and is less than 9° west of Antares. Half an hour after sunset, Mercury is 3.5° high. It sets by 7 p.m. local daylight time.\nSaturn is in the northeastern corner of Aquarius and just over a week past opposition when the month begins. It stands high in the eastern sky after dark and remains visible all night. Saturn is 4° south of the nearly Full Moon on Oct. 5.... Saturn maintains its opposition magnitude of 0.6 for the first week of October and dips to 0.8 by the end of the month, when it stands 816.2 million miles away. A telescope will show a 19″-wide disk. Inspect both hemispheres while the rings are almost edge-on. Look for new white spots that signify storms welling up above the normally yellowish hazy layers.\nThis month the rings' tilt declines from 1.5° to 0.6°. They appear only 0.5″ thick, requiring larger amateur scopes and good seeing to spot. The long axis spans 43″ midmonth.\nTwo transits of Titan — one with its shadow — occur in October. On Oct. 5, Titan's transit begins around 9:25 p.m. EDT (in twilight for the Mountain time zone). It takes about 18 minutes for Titan to fully appear on Saturn's northeastern limb. Shortly after the moon reaches halfway across around 12 a.m. EDT (Oct. 6 in the Eastern time zone), its shadow appears at 12:26 a.m. EDT, crossing the north pole of the planet. The shadow is halfway across at about 1:38 a.m. EDT and leaves the disk from about 2:17 a.m. to 2:42 a.m. EDT. The shallow angle of the limb makes egress very long. Titan reaches the limb at 2:23 a.m. EDT and exits by 2:44 a.m. EDT.... Uranus moves about 1° west during the month. A pair of 6th-magnitude stars (13 and 14 Tauri) standing 20′ apart lie 4.5° south of M45, and Uranus is 3° to 2° east of this pair during the month. The pale green, 4″-wide planetary disk is visible using medium to high magnification through a telescope.\nThis chart shows the sky above the Midwest shortly before the Moon begins to occult the Pleiades. Now Uranus will require optical aid to spot. Credit: Astronomy: Roen Kelly\nA waning gibbous Moon stands 4.7° north of Uranus Oct. 9/10 and crosses the Pleiades, producing a series of occultations. The stars disappear behind the Moon's bright limb, making those events difficult to observe, but reappearances at the dark limb are easier to see. Electra is the first bright star to be occulted from most of North America. The timing will vary with your geographic location. Observing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT will offer the best views (starting on the 9th and ending early on the 10th for those in the eastern half of the U.S.). Check which events are visible from your location under '2025 Predictions' at www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm.... As Io's shadow reaches the western limb at 5:03 a.m. EDT, Io has pulled ahead of Europa and is in the middle of the disk, while Europa lags behind due to its wider orbit. Seeing orbital mechanics at work in one session is rare, so don't miss this.\nBecause Io and Europa are in resonant orbits, similar events occur repeatedly. On Oct. 11, both shadows appear by 4:43 a.m. EDT, with the moons situated off the eastern limb. Io is well ahead of Europa, but its shadow lags behind Europa's. Io reaches the limb at 5:58 a.m. EDT, as its shadow is catching up to Europa's. Europa begins its transit at 6:43 a.m. EDT, just as the shadows almost merge and leave the western limb of the planet 10 minutes later and three minutes apart.\nThe series repeats Oct. 18. This time both shadows begin a transit within six minutes of each other, with Io's shadow leading at 6:36 a.m. EDT. Io's transit starts at 6:52 a.m. CDT, as twilight begins across the Midwest. Western states see the later stages . Europa begins its transit 87 minutes later at 6:19 a.m. PDT, coincidentally shortly after Callisto's shadow begins to transit at the southeastern limb (at 6:07 a.m. PDT).... Pacific Coast observers will see the pair of shadows at the onset of morning twilight Oct. 25, the last in this series for the month.\nVenus rises at 5 a.m. local daylight time on Oct. 1, shining at magnitude –3.9 among the stars of Leo. It crosses into Virgo by the 9th and its elongation from the Sun is declining, so it rises later each morning. It's joined by the waning crescent Moon on the 19th; the pair rises around 5:30 a.m. across North America. They stand less than 4° apart, with the Moon just two days from New. Through a telescope, Venus displays a 94-percent-lit disk spanning 11″.\nBy the end of October, the phase expands to 96 percent and the disk shrinks to 10″. On the 31st Venus stands 4° north of Spica, although the magnitude 1.0 star is difficult to see in the brightening sky.\nNote: Moon phases in the calendar vary in size due to the distance from Earth and are shown at 0h Universal Time.

In the south lie the elongated Schiller and the detail-packed Gassendi; the equator sports the small and sharp Kepler, leading north to the outstanding half-ring of the Jura Mountains. Keep going north for some lunar history.... Did a nova just appear below Saturn? Peaking up to 2nd magnitude, the larger geostationary satellites reflect sunlight from their solar panels. Lower satellites move across the sky, but for these big birds, the sky moves slowly past them. The time of peak brightness shifts about four minutes earlier each night.\nCeres spends all month within a short distance of several bright stars, aiding in its identification.

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:323} an incredible 29 years to race around that track as if it was a horse track in a racetrack. We go around naturally, you\n{ts:330} know, in one year. So looking at Saturn, you may get to see with a do, you know, decent sized telescope a ring system\n{ts:337} that's maybe deployed five or six degrees. We're beginning to see the southern section of the ring as years go\n{ts:343} on. So, don't miss Saturn, a beautiful site deep in the constellation of Aquarius, the water bearer. But for\n{ts:351} other objects, you probably want to look into the eastern part of the sky right after midnight because Jupiter rises,\n{ts:359} the god of gods and the most magnificent planet. And in the early morning sky, Venus is still there. As we look into\n{ts:366} our skies, we see it into the northnortheast before sunrise. The blazing object. Venus is an incredible\n{ts:373} object. Did you know, and I've often mentioned this on the Dr. Sky Experience, that under certain\n{ts:378} conditions, if let's say you live in an area where snow is pretty much uh, you know, prominent, you can actually see... {ts:385} your shadow by the brilliance of Venus. Now, you may wonder, how could that be? Well, if you're in a snowy field because\n{ts:390} of the whiteness of snow and Venus was, of course, you're staring at it and you turned around under super dark\n{ts:397} conditions, you might get to see your shadow, not just like the moon would cast your shadow or the sun in the\n{ts:403} daytime, but the planet Venus itself, which is quite interesting. So, ladies and gentlemen, a good opportunity now to\n{ts:410} talk about a pair of binoculars. Now, I get this question on the Dr. I experience all the time. And you can\n{ts:415} email me with your questions at just drsky at wabcradio.com.\n{ts:421} I'm there for you to answer questions and no question is foolish. I mean, we get questions and help people out.\n{ts:426} That's what we do to explore the mysteries of the universe. So, a pair of binoculars, let's talk about it for a\n{ts:433} moment. You use both eyes. Hopefully, your eyes are in good health. And even if they... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

                "snippet": "{ts:4} [Music] Hello. It's October. Only three more\n{ts:11} months to the end of 20125 and I am just gobsmacked. It's going by so fast. So, let's dive into what you can expect for\n{ts:19} October. Now, I don't know about you, but I feel like September was kind of a doozy. So, let's see what is in store\n{ts:27} for us. And I'm going to again say thank you to the ladies at the wholeness network for having me do their monthly\n{ts:36} um astrological uh series here. And I can't find my advance here. Here we go. Okay. So I love the great blue\n{ts:50} heron. I was uh texting with a friend about the great blue heron and I went on a 12mi run in a Kyhoga Valley National\n{ts:58} Park and I saw this blue heron on a tree stump sticking out of the marsh with his wings like this and and I took several\n{ts:67} pictures of him. He was sleeping and I hadn't put my phone on mute so he kind of like woke up and stuck his little... {ts:74} face out. He's like it was really interesting. So, the great blue heron is amazing and beautiful and things in\n{ts:81} nature can just bring us joy all the time because the natural world is indeed special and magical. So, we didn't\n{ts:88} really cover Libra season uh when I did the September preview because there's so much going on in September. So, we're\n{ts:97} going to talk about that now. So, Libra season is basically from September 22nd, uh, when the sun moves\n{ts:107} into the sign of Libra, we start fall. It's when the autumn equinox happens. Equal light, equal day. And we know what\n{ts:114} that means. The winter solstice is next. And that means the sun has its shortest days. It's kind of that time where we go\n{ts:122} inside and bed things down. So, right now, we're harvesting. We're getting all our stuff\n{ts:128} in. we're kind of preparing for the long dark days and Libra season as we know is symbolized by the scale. Um and it's\n{ts:136} kind of like if you think of the horizon, the sun dipping down, it... 's managing our needs and\n{ts:278} managing the needs of other people with grace. So there's this cooperation in leadership. there's this um taking in\n{ts:286} all the different aspects so that the highest good can be undertaken. Full moons typically are something\n{ts:293} that's revealing. It's it's a celebration. So see if there's some areas of your life um that are kind of\n{ts:300} you know with your relationships or how you assert yourself in the world that might be coming highlighted for you\n{ts:305} during this time. and everybody's chart's personal. But one thing I thought was kind of interesting uh is\n{ts:311} that Mercury is at 0 degrees Scorpio and it's in a quinc con with Neptune. And Mercury and Neptune is an interesting\n{ts:321} combination where uh it can affect how we perceive the world. Um sometimes Neptune can be incredibly spiritual and\n{ts:328} creative. Uh other times it can be confusing or disillusionment. And so it's Mercury is our mind and how we\n{ts:336} perceive things. So if you are someone who is working on um meditation, channeling, uh mediumship, stuff like\n{ts:344} that, psychism, like this could be a really interesting time for you to set that as an intention to really expand... {ts:349} that in your life. Also, if you're like a fantasy writer, mystery writer, um create creative writing in general, or\n{ts:358} even if you're someone who is a poet, uh does automatic writing, this could be really interesting for you as well. So,\n{ts:364} see how those things uh kind of work for you. And then there's also this um Quinn Kunk to Uranus. And Uranus is a god of\n{ts:372} lightning, sudden understanding. Uh it's kind of like a higher octave of Mercury some\n{ts:379} people say. So you could have like really great flashes of insight. Uh so kind of opening up the space for you to\n{ts:386} either be transfused with something amazing like with Neptune being a sort of tuning fork to your head or amazing\n{ts:394} lightning striking with fabulous ideas that you never would have thought of because it's so out of the box. So\n{ts:400} opening up the space for that to see what might happen for you could be fun. And going on to the next thing is we\n{ts:408} have Pluto. Uh it went retrograde May 4th of 2005 and it... 's been 162 days Pluto's been\n{ts:417} retrograde to us our viewpoint and it's now going direct and that's at one degree Aquarius. So when Pluto goes\n{ts:426} backwards it's time for us to kind of take the lessons that we've learned. See how uh I I put these up as a a nice\n{ts:435} visual because I'm I'm starting to think of Pluto as like this forge. It's we don't want to be melted typically, but\n{ts:444} it's like once we're melted, we're pliable. We're in this state of becoming something different. And when\n{ts:452} they used to make swords and whatnot, they would they would put this metal into a forge and\n{ts:458} heat it up and then make these swords and then beat them. And so Pluto transits can sometimes feel like that\n{ts:465} for us where it's like I wouldn't have chosen this for myself, but once the process is done, we're like super\n{ts:472} strong. And I also um put up a pressure cooker because it's I just saw a thing recently where\n{ts:480} someone said the Pluto glyph it's a circle and there's this half crescent and then the cross of matter and it... 's\n{ts:487} almost like someone's like surrendering. They're putting their hands up like this. And so there's an element of\n{ts:493} surrender when Pluto is talking to us or is involved in our chart somehow. And it's it's like our it's not always a\n{ts:502} comfortable feeling to be in a catalyst or a crucible, which is kind of what I feel like with a pressure cooker is, but\n{ts:509} it's it changes us and then we move forward with a totally different perspective on things. So, as Pluto\n{ts:515} starts to go direct now, um the themes of Pluto being in Aquarius will kind of move forward with such things. So, I... {ts:523} know AI has just been huge. It's interesting because uh my uncle worked with IBM for years and he said really AI\n{ts:530} is a program written by a human essentially as the way it is right now the large language model and things like\n{ts:537} that. So, it's may we write programs that are full of love and higher higher um uh purposes\n{ts:548} and for the higher good of everything and kind of avoid anything that might be negative with with those things. So I\n{ts:555} think I just want to say that for for that because Pluto and Aquarius um sometimes it can be like dystopian or we\n{ts:562} always know it's going to be uh but it feels like information and things like that is one of the things that Pluto\n{ts:568} could be talking with with us with it going into Aquarius and power to the people definitely power with people and\n{ts:574} masses of people and grassroots and all that kind of stuff. Oh, I didn't get rid of my drawing. Sorry. Then we have the\n{ts:583} um new moon in Libra and this is happening at 28° Libra. So if you have late degree... {ts:662} Mars loves Scorpio. It it's the rulership is a doicile of Mars um in the nighttime and it's really a powerful\n{ts:671} sign for Mars to be in. So it's easier for Mars to express itself and Mars is our desire, our aggression, how we go\n{ts:677} after what we want, energy, drive, ambition with it right next to Mercury. uh in the previous um full moon we saw\n{ts:686} that Mercury is being aspected by Mercury is aspecting Uranus and Neptune and now we have Mars there. So Mars kind\n{ts:694} of gives this ability to be witty and sharp, incisive uh if you are talking with somebody, watching the potential\n{ts:706} inflammatory aspect like argument potential, but it's also um like like having like something important to say\n{ts:714} and saying it. And I think with the the Libra can kind of bring in that niceness where we can temper it a smidge. Uh but\n{ts:721} seeing how you uh can be clear-cut in your thinking, clearcut in how you're speaking with people and\n{ts:730} could potentially be a little argumentative here and there because Mars can be spicy. I mean definitely",

                "url": "http://www.theskyscrapers.org/october-2025-sky-events",
                "snippet": "October brings some of the most pronounced seasonal changes to our nighttime skygazing. The sounds and smells of summer have passed on, But, with the distinct scent of autumn leaves and the absence of the frogs, katydids, and all but perhaps few enough crickets to count, the still nights of autumn are getting longer, cooler, and quieter.\n\nIn the west, we see Arcturus, the brilliant star that foretells the coming of spring, and has been a presence in our evening sky since, is now low in the sky, soon to trade places to the morning sky.\n\nAs we continue to anticipate the once-in-80-year outburst of the Blaze Star, T Coronae Borealis, we have less time to observe the star during October, as it is getting lower in the northwest after sunset, sets during the mid-to-late evening, and doesn’t rise before the onset of morning twilight until about a week into November.\n\nLooking towards the south, we find our gaze turning away from the glow of the Milky Way, and towards the dimmer constellations of autumn. While Capricornus, Aquarius, Cetus, and Pisces are relatively devoid of bright stars, one notable exception is Pisces Austrinus, which gives us the lone first magnitude star, Fomalhaut, a class A3 main sequence star that lies just 25 light years away. Lying 59° east-southeast from the next-nearest first magnitude star, Altair, Fomalhaut is the most isolated of the first magnitude stars in our sky from our latitude of about 42° north.... ## Moon\n\nTo start the month of October, the 69.9% waxing gibbous Moon is just 0.8° east-southeast of Pluto on the 1st. This pairing would be quite an observing challenge, as the Moon is about 16 billion times brighter than Pluto. Capturing it photographically with a sensitive imaging device is a bit more feasible. If you can observe the two objects simultaneously, consider that Pluto’s light took four hours 51 minutes to reach us, and that the distant dwarf planet is 13,329 times the distance from Earth as the Moon.\n\nOctober 4th is International Observe the Moon Night, but this year we’ll be celebrating on Sunday the 5th. Watch the 98% waxing gibbous Moon rise at 5:34pm over the Seekonk River with Skyscrapers members and friends from Blackstone Field on the East Side of Providence, adjacent to the Narragansett Boat Club on River Drive. Bring a telescope, binoculars, or a camera, and enjoy the moonrise with us. The Moon will be just 2.2° north-northwest of Saturn on this evening. A few hours later, early on the morning of the 6th, the Moon is 1.8° north-northwest of Neptune. Throughout the evening, you should be able to observe all three objects simultaneously in a small telescope with a wide field of view.... The Moon is full at 11:48pm on the 6th, marking 2025’s Harvest Moon, as October’s full Moon is 14.5 hours closer to the equinox than September’s full Moon. The Harvest Moon is in Pisces, and rises at 5:57pm, when the Sun is still above the horizon, making this full Moon rise a very favorable one to photograph.\n\nWe have missed the last several occurrences of it, either because it happens during daylight for us, or the Moon is below the horizon, but October gives us our first nighttime view of the Moon occulting the Pleiades.\n\nThe first of the brighter members, Celaeno (16 Tauri), is occulted beginning at 11:36pm on the 9th. Electra (17 Tauri) is occulted about three minutes later. At 11:54pm, Taygeta (19 Tauri) dips behind the bright limb of the Moon, followed by Maia (20 Tauri) at 12:04am on the 10th.\n\nElectra emerges at 12:19am, followed by Celaeno at 12:39am, Taygeta at 12:58am, and Maia at 1:08am.\n\nThe Moon reaches its most northerly declination during lunation 1271 on the 12th, at +28.27° in the non-zodiacal constellation Auriga.... ## Mercury\n\nMercury spends October in its least favorable evening apparition of the year for northern hemisphere observers. While it reaches its maximum elongation of 23.9° east of the Sun on the 29th, it never spends more than an hour above the horizon following sunset, during which time it remains low over the southwestern horizon.\n\nDue to Mercury’s inclination angle keeping it south of the ecliptic, which is already at a low angle of incidence during October evenings, the planet doesn’t gain considerable elevation over the horizon, but continues to appear further towards the south each evening.\n\nIf you’re searching for Mercury on the 2nd, you may notice magnitude 1.0 Spica, which lies 1.7° to the south-southwest of the magnitude -0.5 planet.\n\nThe innermost planet joins the Moon and Mars, with the three appearing in a line on the 23rd. You’ll be able to locate the 5.3% crescent moon first, then, with binoculars, go 3.9° to the north-northeast, or right and slightly above, to find Mercury. Then, continue along this direction another 3.0° to locate Mars.\n\n## Venus\n\nVenus is now over 1.5 au from Earth, moving along the far side of its orbit towards superior conjunction in early January. It is visible low in the eastern sky before sunrise, rising about 2½ minutes later each morning. Its gibbous disk has shrunk to just about 11 arcseconds, but the planet still retains its brilliance at magnitude -3.9.\n\nVenus crosses into Virgo on the 9th.\n\nOn the 19th, the super slim crescent Moon is just 4.1° southwest of Venus.... ## Saturn\n\nOctober’s evening skies offer Saturn as the only bright planet in an optimal position for viewing. Moving retrograde through Aquarius, the ringed planet can be found in the southeastern sky after twilight fades.\n\nOn the 5th, the nearly full Moon is just 2.2° to the north-northwest of Saturn, and with a wide field telescope, you’ll be able to see not just the Moon and Saturn, but also Neptune, which is 2.0° to the east of the Moon.\n\n**Moons of Saturn**\n\nThe last of Titan’s shadow transits visible to us begins at 12:26am on the 6th, when the shadow of Saturn’s giant moon grazes the northern limb of the planet, departing after 1:42am. As this is still relatively close to Saturn’s opposition, there is also a coinciding transit of the moon itself, beginning at 9:25pm on the 5th, ending at 1:44am on the 6th.\n\nWhile the next shadow transit of Titan will not occur until 2038, the moon itself continues to transit the planet's disk a few more times, and keen observers with larger instruments, exceptionally good observing conditions, and sensitive image equipment may be able to track Saturn’s smaller, inner moons as they continue to cast shadows across the planet’s cloudtops throughout the next several months.\n\nTitan enters occultation at 6:57pm on the 13th, during nautical twilight. It remains behind Saturn and in eclipse until 12:50am.\n\nAnother transit of Titan, without its shadow, takes place on the 21st, beginning at 6:45pm. The moon takes nearly six hours to cross Saturn’s northern equatorial belt.\n\nOn the 29th, Titan emerges from occultation at 10:22pm while partially eclipsed. It comes out of eclipse a few minutes past midnight on the 30th.\n\nTitan comes out of eclipse at 00:00pm on the 29th.... ## Comets\n\n**C/2025 R2 (SWAN)**\n\nDiscovered on September 11, 2025 in images captured with the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument onboard NASA’s Solar and Heliophysics Observatory (SOHO), Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN is in our evening sky throughout October, hovering around 9th magnitude before fading rapidly as it moves out of the inner solar system.\n\nOn the 2nd, it is just 1.0° from Zubenelgenubi (alpha Librae).\n\nOn the 13th, it lies 0.8° south of Sabik (eta Ophiuchi), and on the 17th, it is 1.0° south of Messier 16 in Serpens.\n\nThe comet is nearest to Earth on the 19th, at a distance of 0.261 au, during which time it is moving at a rate of 4.7° per day\n\n**C/2025 A6 Lemmon**\n\nComet C/2025 A6 Lemmon is visible in the northern sky during October.\n\nOn the 6th and 7th, it is located close to Tania Australis (mu Ursae Majoris), the southern star of the middle pair of the Three Leaps of the Gazelle asterism. This part of the sky sets early in the evening, but is once again easy to view in the northeast after 1:00am. The comet may be visible in binoculars, at about magnitude 8.",

                "snippet": "# What's in the sky October 2025\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nWelcome to your October guide to the Southern Hemisphere night sky! This month, we’ve got a fantastic mix of planets, deep sky objects, and even a rare comet to chase. Whether you’re a casual stargazer enjoying the view with binoculars, a telescope enthusiast hunting planets and nebulae, or an astrophotographer capturing the wonders above, there’s plenty to see and explore. From bright planets like Saturn and Mercury to stunning deep sky gems like the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Helix Nebula, October promises plenty of celestial highlights to keep your nights busy.\n\n**Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN**\n\nThis month brings a rare visitor from the outer Solar System: Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, which reaches its closest approach on October 19th, just 0.261 AU from Earth. Last seen in the inner Solar System over 20,000 years ago.\n\nImage Credit: Mike Kane\n\nAfter perihelion on September 12, it developed a striking 5° corkscrew-shaped ion tail visible in photographs. That’s about the length of 10 Full Moons! Currently around magnitude 6, it’s visible with binoculars low on the western horizon just after sunset. Look near Mars and Spica in Virgo to help spot it. As it approaches Earth, it may brighten to magnitude 4, possibly making it visible to the naked eye under dark skies.. This closest approach is due to happen on the 19... th of October, so pencil in the days between the 18 th till the 21 st, as that will hopefully be one of the best opportunities this year to observe a comet. The comet will continue moving through Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius before fading in early November.\n\nAnd since comets can surprise us with sudden changes in brightness or appearance, we’ll be keeping a close eye on Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN. Look out for an updated video and article from us right before the best viewing nights so you’ll know exactly what to expect and how to spot it.\n\n**Mercury**\n\nThis month, we’ve also got the 2\n\nnd best opportunity of the year to observe Mercury, as it reaches its greatest elongation on the 29 th of October. This is when Mercury reaches it’s greatest distance in the sky from the Sun and makes it the best time to observe the planet.\n\nThe greatest elongation of the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is kind of like their version of opposition. It’s not quite the same, as it’s not when the planet is at it’s largest, but it represents the best opportunity to observe the planet, as it signifies when the planet appears to be the farthest distance form the sun in our sky.... If you don’t have an opportunity to observe on exactly the 29\n\nth, don’t worry! While planetary opposition and elongation events are typically given as just one date, the truth is that while this date represents the absolute peak, observing up to a week before or after is often 90% as good! So don’t think you’ve missed out, you haven’t!\n\n**Saturn**\n\nSpeaking of opposition, while Saturn’s opposition has already passed, secretly we actually think now may be a better time to observe. Why? Because while Saturn is ever so slightly smaller than last month, it’s rising earlier in the night, making it easier to observe for those of us keen to maintain a reasonable bedtime!\n\nWhile the best viewing window is still a little late, between 10 and 12pm, you’ll still get great views of the planet anytime after sunset, and Saturn should be fairly easy to spot in the Northeastern area of the sky.\n\n**Neptune**\n\nOnce again Neptune joins us alongside Saturn in the Sky. If you’ve got a scope big enough (we’d typically recommend and aperture of 6 inches or larger), and you can See Saturn in the sky, then you’ll be able to spot Neptune. There’s not much worth looking at in it’s own right, but if you’re already observing Saturn, you may as well turn your scope to the furthest planet in the Solar system.... Like Saturn, Neptune is best observed between 10-12pm, but you’ll be able to see it anytime after sunset.\n\nIf you’re up late, this month also represents a good time to have a look at Uranus. Again if you’ve got the aperture, you’ll see a tiny grey-blue disk. This month it’s really only for the most dedicated planet hunters, as to have a good view of it, you’ll need to be up between 1-3am, as that’s when it’s best positioned for observing in the sky.... ###\n\n**Uranus**\n\n**Deep Sky Objects This Month**\n\n**The Small Magellanic Cloud/SMC (NGC 292)**\n\nThe main attraction this month is one of the gems of the Southern sky, The Small Magellanic cloud. While it doesn’t take up as much of the sky as it’s cousin the Large Magellanic cloud (more on this incredible object come January), there’s nothing Small about this cloud of stars, as it stretches 4 degrees across in the sky (that’s 8 moons across!).\n\nImage Credit: ESO/VISTA VMC\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud, or SMC for short is a satellite galaxy of the Milkyway, meaning the SMC orbits the Milky way much in a similar way to how the Moon orbits the Earth! It’s exclusively visible to us in the southern hemisphere, and is easily one of the gems of the southern sky.\n\nThe SMC is visible to the naked eye from dark sites with little light pollution, and in fact is one of the furthest objects visible with the naked eye, at a distance of 200,000 light years away. Up the magnification and light gathering with a pair of Binoculars and the SMC will stand out even more, and you’ll also be able to make out some of the details of the galaxy itself. Up the Magnification and light gathering even more with a large telescope, and individual features within the SMC become resolvable.... Another great target this month is NGC 7293, the Helix Nebula. Often also known by the much more dramatic name, the Eye of God Nebula, the Helix Nebula is one of the closest Planetary Nebula to Earth, which makes it one of the rare planetary Nebula in the sky large enough to make out considerable detail through a telescope, as well as being large enough to be a great target astrophotography target for small refractors and Smart telescopes.\n\nImage Credit: ESO\n\nThrough the eyepiece, you’ll see an eye shape staring right back, and you’ll see more details the darker your sky, and if you have a UHC filter like this one to boost contrast: https://bintel.com.au/products/astronomik-uhc-filter.\n\nPlanetary nebulae like the Helix are formed during the final stages of a medium-sized star’s life. When stars similar in size to our Sun exhaust the fuel in their cores, they shed their outer layers into space, creating an expanding shell of glowing gas. The exposed hot core, now a white dwarf, emits intense ultraviolet radiation that excites the surrounding gas, causing it to shine in the striking colours we see in photographs. Planetary nebulae aren’t uncommon in the galaxy, but the Helix is special because it’s one of the closest and brightest, making its structure and details much easier to observe.... The Helix Nebula is another quintessentially Southern object. While it is technically observable from the Northern Hemisphere, they don’t get to see it quite like we do, as we get to see it rise right overhead in the night sky.\n\nYou’ll find the Helix nebula in the constellation Aquarius, and it’s best observed between 8 to 10pm, when its at its highest in the night sky.\n\nAnd that brings an end to this month’s guide to the night sky. October offers an incredible variety of observing opportunities for Southern Hemisphere stargazers. From the bright planets like Saturn, Mercury, and Neptune, to a rare visitor from the outer Solar System in Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN, there’s something for every type of observer, no matter if you’re up late hunting faint outer planets or enjoying a relaxed evening spotting a comet low on the horizon. The deep sky is equally rewarding, with the Small Magellanic Cloud and its internal treasures like NGC 346, as well as the Helix Nebula, giving both visual observers and astrophotographers stunning targets to explore. With clear skies, dark horizons, and a mix of familiar and extraordinary objects, October is shaping up to be a month that truly showcases the richness of our southern night sky.",

The Orionids are typically a medium-low strength shower producing up to 20 meteors per hour from a dark site. If you are going to observe the Orionids, this is a great year for it. Moonlight will not interfere with observing. It is very close to a new Moon, so the Moon isn’t up for most observers for almost all of the night, and either dark or just the thinnest of crescents shortly before dawn.

                "snippet": "## Key Takeaways:\n\n- Saturn maintains high visibility in October, located in Aquarius with its rings appearing nearly edge-on (tilting from 1.5° to 0.6°), which enhances observation of its atmospheric details and major moons.\n\n- Mercury and Mars are prominent in the western evening sky, with a close approach (2° separation) between the two occurring on October 19, and Mercury reaching greatest elongation on October 29.\n\n- Jupiter is observable post-midnight in Gemini, presenting opportunities for detailed viewing of its atmosphere and Galilean moons, while Venus shines brightly low in the eastern morning twilight.\n\n- A lunar occultation of Antares by a waxing crescent Moon is predicted for October 25, visible from southern South America, alongside features of the constellation Pisces, including the \"Circlet\" asterism and its proximity to the vernal equinox.\n\n**Saturn** takes center stage once darkness falls in October. Although the ringed world reached opposition and peak visibility in late September, the view this month is almost as good. The magnitude 0.7 planet lies in the northeastern corner of Aquarius the Water-bearer and appears far brighter than any nearby star. This area climbs highest in the north in late evening.\n\nSaturn’s icy rings always bring a thrill to backyard observers. Yet the excitement is muted a bit in October because the rings appear nearly edge-on. They tilt 1.5° to our line of sight on the 1st and just 0.6° on the 31st. With the rings creating less distraction, look for subtle atmospheric detail on the planet itself. Saturn’s moons also become easier to spot with the reduced glare from the rings. Titan shows up through any telescope, while Tethys, Dione, and Rhea emerge in a good 10cm instrument.... As the month progresses, you can watch Mercury and Mars dance low in the western evening sky.\n\n**Mars** makes its final evening stand in October as it sinks deeper into twilight. The ruddy world appears only 4″ across through a telescope, too small to show any detail.\n\nThe Red Planet’s main interest this month is its approach to\n\n**Mercury**. The innermost planet becomes visible in early October and climbs into a darker sky as the month progresses. On the 19th, the two worlds stand side by side with just 2° separating them. Magnitude –0.2 Mercury lies to the left of its magnitude 1.5 sister world. Their official conjunction arrives 2 days later.\n\nMercury reaches greatest elongation Oct. 29, when it stands 24° east of the Sun and appears 11° high an hour after sundown. A telescope reveals the planet’s 7″-diameter gibbous disk.\n\nYou’ll have to wait until after midnight to see\n\n**Jupiter**. The giant planet appears against the backdrop of eastern Gemini, above that constellation’s two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux. At magnitude –2.2, Jupiter easily outshines the stars in its vicinity.... The best views through a telescope come once the planet climbs higher with the approach of dawn. Jupiter spans 38″ at midmonth and should show significant detail in its atmosphere. Meanwhile, its four bright moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which Galileo discovered in 1610 — stand out in any size scope. I often find Jupiter looks best with a touch of twilight in the sky, so you might want to try that trick.\n\nThe brightest planet hangs low in the east during morning twilight.\n\n**Venus** shines at magnitude–3.9 but stands only 5° above the horizon 30 minutes before sunrise. The inner planet won’t look like much through a telescope. In mid-October, its disk appears 11″ in diameter and nearly full.\n\nA waxing crescent Moon occults 1st-magnitude Antares in Scorpius on Oct. 25. People in the southern part of South America can see an 11-percent-lit Luna overtake the red supergiant star and hide it from view for nearly an hour. From Punta Arenas, Chile, the pair lies low in the west-southwest in the early evening sky. Antares disappears behind the Moon’s dark limb at 1h37m UT (locally the evening of the 24th) and reappears at 2h28m UT.... ## The starry sky\n\nPisces the Fish has always struck me as a curious constellation. Ancient skygazers developed several stories as to why a constellation with two fish even exists. Some suggest the two fish carried Eros and Aphrodite away from the danger posed by a monster called Typhon, or that Eros and Aphrodite were turned into fish themselves.\n\nIn October, the entire star group clears the northeastern horizon by midevening. Although Pisces’ stars are rather faint, the constellation is easy to find this year because it lies directly below the prominent planet Saturn, which lies in neighboring Aquarius.\n\nThe fish stand a full 30° apart in the sky. An angled cord of stars, whose mythological origin and meaning remain obscure, joins the two. The northern fish lies well north of the celestial equator, at a declination of 30°. You can find it northwest (to the left) of the trio of bright stars Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ) Arietis.\n\nThe southern fish resides just north of the celestial equator. This collection of 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars creates a fairly conspicuous asterism known as the Circlet. The stars Iota (ι), Theta (θ), Gamma, Kappa (κ), and Lambda (λ) Piscium form a pattern close to a regular pentagon. The shape appears more rounded when you add 7 and TX Psc.\n\nAlthough the Circlet asterism lies entirely north of the equator, a small chunk of Pisces south of this asterism extends to negative declinations. The cord connecting the two fish runs eastward from the Circlet to the magnitude 3.8 star Alrescha (Alpha Psc) at the constellation’s southeastern corner. The star’s name comes from an Arabic word meaning “the cord.” A small telescope shows it to be a close binary comprising two whitish stars. A jagged line of fainter stars connects Alrescha with the northern fish.\n\nThe Circlet asterism also serves as a guide to locating the point on the sky known as the vernal equinox. This spot marks one of the two positions where the ecliptic — the apparent path of the Sun across our sky — crosses the celestial equator. The equinox lies some 5° southeast (to the lower right in October’s evening sky) of the asterism.... ## Star Dome\n\nThe map below portrays the sky as seen near 30° south latitude. Located inside the border are the cardinal directions and their intermediate points. To find stars, hold the map overhead and orient it so one of the labels matches the direction you’re facing. The stars above the map’s horizon now match what’s in the sky.\n\nThe all-sky map shows how the sky looks at:\n\n10 p.m. October 1\n\n9 p.m. October 15\n\n8 p.m. October 31\n\nPlanets are shown at midmonthOctober2025-SouthernHemisphereDownload",

It is defined as the closest Full Moon to autumnal (fall) equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAs well as being named after the harvest season in the northern half of the globe, the moonrise times around Full Moon at the autumnal equinox are favorable to getting in the harvest. This is because the difference in the time between moonrise from one night to the next becomes\n\n**less than the average of 50 minutes**. The result is that, for **several nights in a row, there’s extra moonlight in the evenings**. Historically, this gave farmers more time to harvest crops.\n\nThe opposite takes effect in the Southern Hemisphere around the September equinox with\n\n**more** than 50 minutes between moonrise from one day to the next around the Full Moon.... ## Two Meteor Showers in October\n\nMeteors, or shooting stars, are the bright streaks of light that occur when a meteoroid—a rock in space—hits our atmosphere and burns up. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid.\n\nOctober boasts two meteor showers: the\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaking around October 8–9, and the **Orionid meteor shower** peaking around October 20–21. The bad news is that the glare from the bright Full Moon will reduce the number of Draconids that are visible this year. The good news is that the Orionids peak close to New Moon, when the night sky is at its darkest.\n\nThe origin of the Draconids is the dust trail left by comet\n\n**21P/Giacobini-Zinner**. Meanwhile, the Orionids have a more famous parent body: **Halley’s Comet**. Have a look at our tips for watching meteor showers.\n\n## Coral Spawning Follows October Full Moon\n\nIn the days after Full Moon in October and November, corals in Australia’s\n\n**Great Barrier Reef** simultaneously release bundles of eggs and sperm into the sea. This phenomenon is called **coral spawning**.\n\nThe event only happens at night, and its timing hinges on a number of factors including Moon phase, water temperatures, salinity levels, and the length of day.\n\nIn the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the inshore reefs usually spawn in\n\n**October**; the outer reefs tend to spawn during **November** or **December**. Meanwhile at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Texas and Louisiana in the USA, coral spawning typically happens after the **August** Full Moon.... ## Mercury Makes a Bright Appearance\n\nMercury shines bright on October 29 as it reaches its\n\n**greatest elongation east**. In general, the days on either side of greatest elongations are the best time to catch the innermost planet in our solar system.\n\nBecause Mercury is small and lies close to the Sun, it can be a challenge to observe. But at greatest elongation east, there is a chance to see it with the naked eye soon after sunset.\n\nAnd the elusive Mercury tends to favor one or other of the hemispheres—this time stargazers in the\n\n**Southern Hemisphere** get the best view.\n\nThere will be a close approach of Mercury and Mars on\n\n**October 20**, seen here from Sydney, Australia, as the two planets set.\n\nAnd on\n\n**October 23**, the Waxing Crescent Moon will join Mercury and Mars—as seen here in Sydney at around 20:15 (8:15 pm) local time.\n\n**But beware:** Do not try to observe objects close to the Sun while any part of the Sun is above the horizon. Never point binoculars or a telescope in the direction of the Sun—it **can cause permanent eye damage**.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Which planets are in the night sky tonight?\n\nOur Interactive Night Sky Map gives the rise and set times for the planets in your town or city.... ## How many planets are there?\n\nAccording to the latest definition, there are 8 planets in our solar system.\n\n## How long does it take to get to Venus?\n\nA typical journey time is around four or five months.",

Email Greg your space questions and he might answer them in the next edition.**\n\nWelcome to WTOP’s monthly feature, “What’s up in the sky?” Each month it features the best the sky has to offer stargazers regarding the moon, planets and stars. Space-related events that might interest you taking place in the D.C. area are included as well.\n\nLet’s get to the sky for October 2025!\n\n**Must-see sky sights for October**\n\nDuring October 2025, Venus continues to be the “Morning Star” in the east before dawn, albeit lower in the sky but still bright. The beautiful and bright winter constellations keep Venus celestial company making for a wondrous sky sight. The moon joins up with Venus too for a must-see sky sight.\n\nThe zodiacal light will be visible in the eastern pre-dawn sky for about two weeks starting on the 19th.\n\nThe Orionid Meteor Shower will happen on the night of Oct. 20-21.\n\n**Star of the month:** **Algol **\n\nIn October, be on the lookout for Algol — the “Demon Star” — so named because of its regular change in brightness. Algol is a variable star that undergoes very regular intervals between its maximum and minimum brightness. You can use this tool to determine when Algol will be at its dimmest for several hours.... It is quite intriguing to watch the star change brightness. You can try imaging this process as well with your camera/smartphone.\n\n**Highlights of the month**\n\nOn Oct. 1 in the southwest, the center and brightest part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, is visible for a few hours after dark before it sets. You need a dark sky site and a moonless night to see the Milky Way at its best.\n\nAs October begins, the Summer Triangle is high overhead with the Milky Way running through it as it flows across the sky to the northeast. As the night heads into the hours before dawn, the “Winter Milky Way” is visible in the southeast to the northwest. You can see the Milky Way with a smartphone and/or camera by taking time exposures. For the best results, use a tripod.\n\n**Oct. 4:** International Observe the Moon Night is on this night. Check out the website for information on events, and of course, the moon!\n\n**Oct. 5:** As it gets dark, Saturn and the almost full moon rise in the east — a mere two degrees apart.\n\n**Oct. 6:** The full harvest supermoon is at 11:47 p.m. Eastern Time and rises at sunset in the East. This is the first full supermoon of 2025 and the largest and brightest full moon of 2025. Should be a grand sight at sunset! Get your smartphone/camera ready.... **Oct. 9:** Starting at 11:30 p.m. and lasting for about 2.5 hours, the bright moon passes through the Pleiades star cluster late in the evening covering, or occulting, some of the stars. Binoculars will enhance the view.\n\n**Oct. 19:** A must see in the pre-dawn sky in the east is the very old, waning crescent moon with Earthshine joining up with Venus at just four degrees apart. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.\n\n**Oct. 19:** While looking at the moon and Venus, be on the lookout for the zodiacal light. For about two weeks, it will be visible in the northern hemisphere in the eastern pre-dawn sky, and for the southern hemisphere in the west after sunset. You will need a dark sky site and clear horizon to see this ghostly pyramid shape in the sky. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.\n\n**Night of Oct. 20-21:** The Orionid Meteor Shower graces our dark, moonless sky. Under these sky conditions, the Orionids exhibit a maximum of about 10-20 meteors per hour.\n\n**Oct. 24:** If you have a straight line horizon in the southwest with no obstructions, at twilight look to the southwest to see the young waxing crescent moon very near Antares. To the lower right and just above the horizon Mercury and dimmer Mars are paired up. You will most likely need binoculars to see this. Try taking a smartphone/camera picture.... **The moon**\n\n**Oct. 6-7:** Full harvest supermoon\n\n**Oct.** **13:** Last quarter\n\n**Oct. 21: **New moon\n\n**Oct. 29:** First quarter\n\n**Planets**\n\nMercury is favorable for Southern Hemisphere viewers.\n\nVenus is bright but lower above the eastern horizon before dawn.

                "snippet": "## Meteor Showers in Early and Late October\n\n### The Draconids – Dragon Meteors Under a Bright Moon\n\nThe\n\n**Draconid meteor shower** peaks around October 8, 2025, but this year the “Dragon” will have its fire stolen by moonlight. The Draconids are a minor shower (often only ~10 meteors per hour under dark skies [1]), and unfortunately a **full Moon on October 6–7** will flood the night sky with light during the peak [2]. The bright moonlight will wash out all but the brightest Draconid meteors, making them hard to spot. Best chance to catch a few “shooting stars” from Draco’s radiant (near the Dragon’s head in the northern sky) is *as soon as darkness falls* on October 8, before the Moon rises too high [3]. This unusual timing – evening instead of predawn – is because Draconid meteors fly in the early night hours (the shower’s radiant is highest in the sky at nightfall) [4].\n\nWhy bother with a faint shower? The Draconids are infamous for occasional\n\n**outbursts**. In rare years, if Earth passes through a dense clump of debris from the shower’s parent comet (21P/Giacobini-Zinner), the Draconids have surprised observers with hundreds or even thousands of meteors per hour (notably in 1933 and 1946) [5] [6]. Most years are quiet, but the comet did reach perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in March 2025, raising the *possibility* of enhanced activity [7] [8]. “Watch out if the Dragon awakes!” writes one skywatching columnist – that slim chance of a meteor storm keeps many enthusiasts outdoors **even in moonlight** during this shower [9]. While a storm is not expected, keep an eye on the northern sky on October 8–9 just in case. (The Draconids favor observers in the **Northern Hemisphere**; those far south won’t see much, as Draco sits low or below the horizon.)... ## Planetary Highlights and Conjunctions\n\nOctober 2025 offers plenty of planet spotting opportunities. Two bright planets,... **at peak brilliance**in these weeks – astronomers rate it around magnitude –4.5, the brightest it gets all year [48] [49]. **Tip:**after observing Venus and the Moon, scan higher up for fainter **Mars**(see below) and toward the west for Jupiter setting at dawn. **Mercury and Mars at Dusk:**Fleet-footed **Mercury**makes a challenging appearance in late October. On **October 29**, Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation, 23° away from the Sun in the evening sky [50]. This is actually Mercury’s *last*evening apparition of 2025, but it’s not particularly favorable for those in the Northern Hemisphere. Even at maximum separation, Mercury will be low in the bright twilight (it sets shortly after the Sun). Still, around the final week of October, persistent observers might catch Mercury as a faint “star” very low on the **west-southwest horizon**about 30–45 minutes after sunset [51]. Binoculars will help you spot it in the glow. (Observers in the Southern Hemisphere get a slightly better viewing angle, so Mercury will be a bit higher for them.) Intriguingly, **Mars**is also lurking in the same area of sky. Mars, now on the far side of the Sun and very faint, has been sinking into the sunset glare each evening. Around **October 19–23**, Mercury and Mars actually pass each other in what would be a *conjunction*– but this happens so deep in twilight that it’s a tough observation. Mercury is emerging upward from solar conjunction while Mars is vanishing downward into it, so they are both extremely low after sunset [52]. High Point Scientific notes this pairing gives a brief opportunity to see the two planets close together as they trade places relative to the Sun [53]. If you have a **very clear view of the western horizon**on Oct. 19–20, you might attempt a sighting: about 15–20 minutes after sunset, scan for Mercury (the brighter of the two) and see if you can also glimpse dim Mars nearby. Realistically, Mars will likely be invisible without a telescope. By early November, Mars is in conjunction with the Sun and gone. So think of this as **Mercury’s farewell to Mars**in the twilight – a symbolic handoff from one planet to the other.... ## Comets and Cosmic Visitors\n\nComet enthusiasts have much to be excited about in late 2025. October brings the potential for... *(Comet source refs: StarWalk/Starry Night guides [88] [89] [90]; NASA Science [91] [92]; Chron/EarthSky for context [93].)*... ## Auroras on the Rise – Eyes North (or South)!\n\nHigh-latitude skywatchers should stay alert this October for\n\n**aurora borealis** (Northern Lights) or aurora australis (Southern Lights). Solar activity is near its 11-year peak in 2025 – in fact, the Sun’s **solar maximum** is predicted for around July 2025 [94]. That means the Sun is freckled with sunspots and prone to eruptions like flares and coronal mass ejections, which send charged particles hurtling toward Earth. When those particles strike our atmosphere, they trigger the glowing curtains of auroras. The past year has already seen an uptick in auroral displays, and experts say 2025 will continue the trend [95] [96]. *“Aurora activity can often peak after solar maximum, meaning that the next couple of years will likely be an exciting time for aurora watchers,”* notes Dr. Renate Mauland-Hus, an astrophysicist interviewed by TimeandDate [97].\n\nOctober (along with the spring) is traditionally an excellent season for auroras because of the\n\n**equinox effect** – for reasons still being studied, geomagnetic disturbances seem to be more frequent around the equinoxes. With the **nights growing longer** in October, any geomagnetic storm has more hours of darkness to be observed. In practical terms, this means if the Sun belches out a strong Earth-directed solar flare or CME in September/October, auroras could potentially be visible farther from the poles than usual. Already in late 2024 and early 2025, auroras have been sighted at unusually low latitudes during big solar storms [98]. So if you live in **northern Europe, Canada, the northern U.S.** or similarly high latitudes (or the far southern hemisphere equivalents), keep an eye on space weather alerts. A good resource is NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center aurora forecasts or local observatory announcements.... While not a scheduled “event” like an eclipse, an auroral outbreak can be one of the most awe-inspiring skywatching experiences. Imagine curtains of green and purple light dancing on the horizon or overhead – it’s worth braving a cold night if an alert goes out. Even weaker geomagnetic activity can produce a diffuse green glow low in the north. City dwellers might not see much, but under dark rural skies the aurora can be stunning.\n\n**Bottom line:** 2025 is shaping up to be a top-notch aurora year, and **October’s aurora outlook is promising** due to the active Sun. As one astronomy site put it, *“With the Sun at solar maximum, 2025 promises more chances to witness incredible displays of the northern and southern lights.”* [99] So, if you’re in the auroral zone, be ready to “look up” on short notice when the solar wind delivers a geomagnetic surprise.\n\n*(Aurora source refs: TimeandDate [100], NOAA forecasts, Space.com solar cycle outlook [101].)*\n\n**Further Resources:** For more detailed guidance on these events, check out NASA’s monthly *“What’s Up”* skywatching video series [102], which often covers planetary positions and moon phases. Astronomy and space news sites like **Space.com** and **EarthSky** provide up-to-date observing tips and charts for meteor showers and conjunctions. Many national observatories (e.g., the **Royal Observatory Greenwich** or **U.S. Naval Observatory**) post monthly sky highlights on their websites, tailored to different regions. And if you plan to photograph the sky, don’t forget to consult aurora alerts or meteor shower live streams (the Virtual Telescope Project, for example, often hosts live feeds of celestial events [103]).... With a little planning, October 2025 could be an unforgettable month of skywatching. From the eerie\n\n**Draconid meteors**under an autumn sky, to the crisp mornings with **Venus and the crescent Moon**, to the spectacle of a **Harvest supermoon**, there’s a bounty of cosmic wonders to enjoy. So bundle up, find a dark sky if you can, and **enjoy the show** – the universe is putting on one nightly above us.

                "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## Filmography\n|Year|Title|Role|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|2018|*Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*|Herself|Contestant; winner|\n|2019|*Mani*|Jade|Main role (season 4)|\n|2020|*The Drew Barrymore Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Tom Green, Tabitha Brown\"|\n|2020|*Polly Pocket*|Herself (voice)|2 episodes|\n|2021|*Attaway General*|Jade|Episode: \"Difference Of Opinion\"|\n|2022|*The Tiny Chef Show*|Herself|Episode: \"Snap Pea Stir Fry\"|\n|2022|*Hell's Kitchen: Battle of the Ages*|Herself|Episode: \"Clawing Their Way to the Top\"|\n|2025|*Sneaks*|Sky (voice)| |\n\n## See also\n- Great Britain at the Olympics\n\n## References",

And when we finish skating, we don’t chill. We just play something else.”\n\nWhether it’s dancing or skating or surfing, Sky knows no limits, and she’s taking her generation to the top with her. “I love to prove people wrong and show that age or size just does not matter for skateboarders,” she says. “I want to show the world that if you believe in yourself and just go for it, you can do anything.”\n\n### “We have a lot of energy to skate for hours and hours.

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... 's nearest neighbor, the moon. We start off the month of October finding out that\n{ts:137} the moon is moving on from its waxing phase to a beautiful full phase on Monday, October the 6th. Now, many of\n{ts:146} you have heard of a harvest moon. And what is a harvest moon? It's the full moon that lies closest to the date of\n{ts:153} the autumnal equinox or the beginning of fall. Fall began, as many of you might know, back on September the 21st. So,\n{ts:162} the closest full moon to it would wind up being in early October. So, that date happens to be on the 6th at 11:48 p.m.\n{ts:172} Eastern Daylight Time. So, a quick history of the harvest moon. Why is it called that? In days when we were much\n{ts:179} more of an agricultural society and with crop you know crops being at the plentiful time for harvesting\n{ts:187} the light of the moon the full moon would help farmers to harvest crops. But astronomically this particular full moon\n{ts:194} the harvest moon rises very short shortly that is after sunset. So simple English we find out that this moon would... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

                "snippet": "# From streets to stadiums: Sky Brown, the youngest Olympic Medallist\n\nEmmy Schouten\n\nSky Brown (16) is one of the most talented skateboarders at this years Olympics. After her bronze medal in Tokyo, Sky is hungry for more. We’ll show you her journey to the Paris Olympics!\n\nMulti-talented\n\nSky Brown is half-British half-Japanese! Born in Miyazaki, her original name is Sukai Buraun (スカイ). Her dad Stuart is British, making here eligible to represent the UK on the Olympics. But he moved to the US before she was born. Sky spends half the year in Japan and the other half in the United States for school. She knows how to keep herself busy. If she’s not skateboarding, you can find her surfing, following guitar lessons or doing some jiu jitsu. Especially surfing is one of her big talents. Her original plan was to compete in\n\n*both* skateboarding and surfing at the Paris Olympics. She failed to qualify at the World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico. Despite not hitting her goal, everybody is super proud. And she’ll definitely try again for the 2028 Olympics ;). Her skateboarding career is the most successful yet. Sky started out with some YouTube tutorials and never had a coach. You can find her practicing in Huntington Beach LA. Sometimes she is joined by 3-time gold snowboarding medallist Shaun White who lives just around the corner.... Fun fact: Did you know that know that Sky won\n\n*Dancing with The Stars; Juniors* in 2018? Prizes\n\nAt just 9-years old, Sky participated in the Vans US Open. The youngest ever to do so! One year later, she became a professional skateboarder, again the youngest ever to do so ;). After her professional debut the prizes started coming. Sky won bronze and gold on the World Championships, two gold medals on the X Games, and silver and gold on the Dew Tour. But her best achievement was at the Tokyo Olympics. It was the year skateboarding debuted on the Olympics. Sky immediately took home bronze. At 13 years old, this made her the youngest UK Olympic medallist ever.\n\nA big inspiration\n\nHer skateboarding achievements inspire girls all over the globe. She became an instant role model. With partnerships from Nike, shoe and skate collaborations, Sky created her own brand. People come up to her wearing her helmet or using her skateboard. It pushes her to be the best version of herself everyday. Her message is clear: don’t care what people think. Everybody just has one life and you can’t let anybody stop you from what you want to do. It is her dream to inspire girls. Not even just in skateboarding, but whatever they want to do. This “Sky Brown-effect” is huge in the UK. In the last 5 years, skateboarding in London grew with 800%! A major part of this is girls hitting the streets after Sky’s Olympic performance.... No pressure\n\nEven with all eyes on her, Sky feels no pressure. Skateboarding is all about fun for her. She never sees it as practicing, it is her happy-place. Skating is her “playground”, and this year La Concorde in Paris will be hers. See her in action on August 6!",

                "snippet": "# Welcome To The ‘Top Chef’ of Surfboard Shaping\n\nEight men face off at the 2025 Boardroom Show — Eric Arakawa deems Dan Mann victorious.\n\n**Ideas are fleeting, but carrying them out requires perseverance, stones and sheer bloody-mindedness.**\n\nOne fruit of such labour is The Boardroom Show, an annual celebration of surfboards and their shapers that’s just completed its 24th edition at the Del Mar, CA, Fairgrounds.\n\n“The idea came from the Clark Foam closure in ’05,” says Boardroom Show’s founder Scott Bass. “There was a lot of shapers that I looked up to who didn’t have anywhere to put their wares.’\n\n“Retailers were filling their brick and mortars with overseas stuff—which I don’t blame them for—but in the meantime, the local shaper was getting left out. These guys are crucial to our culture, so I thought we had to do something to showcase them. That’s kind of the nexus of the whole deal.”\n\nScott had a dream: a festival of the surfboard that showcased the best of what the world’s rich array of board builders big-and-small had to offer.\n\nClearly, someone had to pay for this thing, so Scott put down his own capital, then decided to start at the top and work his way down. The results were instant and encouraging.... “I called Rusty (Preisendorfer) that first year and said, ‘Rusty, if I do this, will you get a booth?’” Scott explains. “He was like, ‘Yeah you can count on me.’ And then I called Matt Biolos and said, ‘Matt, if I do this, will you get a booth?’ And Matt said, ‘Yes.’ So I had two of the stalwarts of the surfboard industry agree to do it, then it just sort of took off from there.”\n\nWhat’s materialised from that point is far more nuanced than a room full of stacked racks. Clearly a creative romantic, Scott’s baby has morphed into a blend of competition, trade show and celebration, with themes galore. The brand booth set-up is pretty self-explanatory, featuring surfboards, hardware, all things surf — but the competition side is where things really get interesting.\n\nEvery year The Boardroom Show honours a shaper (in the past they’ve had Al Merrick, Simon Anderson, MR, John Bradbury, to name but a few) in their ‘Icons of Foam Shape-Off’ — a competition where board-builders chosen by the iconic shaper have to recreate some of\n\n*their* classic designs, all by hand, under a time limit, for a shot at the crown.... This year is was the legendary Hawaiian shaper Eric Arakawa, and the shapers he chose to recreate his designs were Dan Mann, Todd Proctor, Adam Warden, Chris Christenson, Richie Collins, Barry Van der Meulen Rodolfo Klima, and Allen White, who qualified for winning the shape-off element of the Surf Expo on the east coast.\n\nThe boards in question featured, “A Derek Ho tri-fin from his ’93 World Title winning campaign, a Waimea Bay gun he made for Ronnie Burns in ’86, then the Andy Irons board that he won the Pipe Masters and the World Title on in 2003.” Scott explains. “It’s strictly timed — they get to look at and measure the original board, then their hour and a half starts. Two shapers at a time, side by side like man-on-man heat.”\n\nEric Arakawa then judged the winner, and interestingly it was Dan Mann, who took down Allen White the wildcard in the final.\n\nApart from the ‘Icons of Foam’ there were all sorts of interesting components to The Boardroom Show, like a VIP dinner where eight paying customers got to hang and fine-dine with Eric and guests, and another, more low key shape-off that Scott describes as “The... *British Bake Off* of surfboards.”\n\n“It’s called the ‘Best in Show’ competition, it’s open to any board builder around the world. It’s free, and the public vote on the winner,” Scott says. “All you got to do is build a board and bring it to the show.”\n\nAs with everything Boardroom Show, there’s a theme (this is the\n\n*Bake-Off* Part), and this year Scott told competitors to, “Go make us a fish, but I want you to add wooden accents to the board and include meaningful symbology — maybe it’s your grandfather’s purple heart or your daughter’s astrological sign…”\n\nThe ‘Best in Show’ in 2025 was won by Steve Farwell of Farwell Surboards from Newport Beach, CA, who’ll receive a free booth at the next Boardroom Show for his troubles.\n\nBasically if you nerd-out on high-end surfboards (aka you surf at all), be sure to try get to the 25th instalment of the Boardroom Show.\n\nApart from supporting craftsmen big and small, you’ll be vindicating an idea, which is always a worthwhile pursuit in our books.\n\n*Give them a follow on IG for all Boardroom Show updates.*\n\n**For the three people on whom our sarcasm is lost: Gerry Lopez and Eric Arakawa. *... ## Most Recent\n\n## Welcome To The ‘Top Chef’ of Surfboard Shaping\n\nEight men face off at the 2025 Boardroom Show — Eric Arakawa deems Dan Mann…\n\n## Watch: ‘Feels Like Yesterday’ Starring The Colapinto Bros, Cole Houshmand & San Clemente’s Electric Youth\n\nA Film of the Year contender by Jacob Vanderwork.\n\n## Shane Borland Crowned World’s Best Surf/Skate Crossbreed At Keris Cup\n\n+ Sky Brown dislocates her shoulder, still packs proper Padang tube.\n\n## America’s Greatest East Coast Surf Town Is Disappearing\n\nA story of Atlantic storms, Cold War ghosts and institutional negligence.\n\n## “We Sat On These Concrete Expansion Joints Right Under The Air Section — But For Rasta Robb We Needed A New Marker”\n\nBill Morris + Ryan Heywood tell the story behind 19 unseen frames from the Stab…\n\n## Watch: Craig Anderson in ‘Samudra Spirit Glitters’\n\n\"I feel people can smell the process.

[Music]\n{ts:69} I'm Dr. Sky and welcome once again to the Dr. Sky Experience here on Talk Radio 77 WABC.\n{ts:77} As we like to say, WABC, the crown jewel of radio heard in 173 countries in all 50 states, beaming out of New York City,\n{ts:87} the nation, the world, and out to the cosmos, and I'm even confident, all the way deeper into the universe. Thank you\n{ts:95} for joining us for our first edition of our sky report for October Skies 2025. Did you know that October skies across\n{ts:104} much of the nation in the northern hemisphere and many nations in the northern hemisphere bring about some of\n{ts:109} the clearest skies of the year? Myself here in Phoenix, Arizona, we're just getting over a rather weak monsoon\n{ts:117} called, in my words, a nonssoon. But hopefully your skies will be clear. Let's take that journey as we continue\n{ts:124} to move out from planet number three, as Carl Sean described it as the pale blue dot. And here's what you can expect as\n{ts:130} we move on to the position of Earth... {ts:202} be higher in the sky. Normally a moon takes about 50 minutes each night rising later. But the beauty of that full moon\n{ts:209} is in abundance. So don't miss it. In days of antiquity going back in, let's say the 1920s and 30s, did you know\n{ts:217} there were great harvest moon balls where women dressed up in beautiful couture gowns, gentlemen in tuxedos, and\n{ts:223} bands played and food flowed and drinks flowed in this most amazing event. So simply you can see the beautiful full\n{ts:231} harvest moon. Then after that, the moon waines. It moves on to its last quarter on the 13th of October. And finally, we\n{ts:238} get a new moon on the 21st. And we'll talk more about the benefits of that new moon on the 21st. Then the lunar cycle\n{ts:246} continues. Look for that thin sliver of moonlight starting on the evening sky of about the 22nd due southswest.\n{ts:254} And then we move on to first quarter on the 29th of October, just around the time of Halloween. But for planets,... {ts:262} ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the activity is now centered in the early evening and early morning skies. Let's\n{ts:269} begin with the early evening. The original ring planet, as I like to call it, Saturn, came to opposition during\n{ts:276} the latter part of September. What does that mean? It means when a planet or an object is at opposition, it rises at\n{ts:282} sunset and it of course stays into the sky until it sets around sunrise. So, we find out that the planet Saturn is easy\n{ts:289} to see. How do you see it? Look to the southeast. The object that you see that's probably about 10 or 15 degrees\n{ts:295} high, not super bright, is the planet Saturn. If you look at it in a telescope, you'll notice that the ring\n{ts:302} system is barely visible. So every 15 years, we go through the orbital plane of Saturn's rings. Meaning, if you hold\n{ts:309} your hand at arms length and sh see it with the thinnest part of your hands without the fingers all showing, then\n{ts:315} move your hand up and down, the ring system tips as we go around. And as Saturn goes around the sun, Saturn takes... {ts:385} your shadow by the brilliance of Venus. Now, you may wonder, how could that be? Well, if you're in a snowy field because\n{ts:390} of the whiteness of snow and Venus was, of course, you're staring at it and you turned around under super dark\n{ts:397} conditions, you might get to see your shadow, not just like the moon would cast your shadow or the sun in the\n{ts:403} daytime, but the planet Venus itself, which is quite interesting. So, ladies and gentlemen, a good opportunity now to\n{ts:410} talk about a pair of binoculars. Now, I get this question on the Dr. I experience all the time. And you can\n{ts:415} email me with your questions at just drsky at wabcradio.com.\n{ts:421} I'm there for you to answer questions and no question is foolish. I mean, we get questions and help people out.\n{ts:426} That's what we do to explore the mysteries of the universe. So, a pair of binoculars, let's talk about it for a\n{ts:433} moment. You use both eyes. Hopefully, your eyes are in good health. And even if they... {ts:529} really dig into the story, we find out that Chuck Joerger actually broke the sound barrier back in October the 14th\n{ts:535} of 1947 with the glamorous Glennness, that particular rocket plane. So if you have\n{ts:542} questions about all these things that are going on in the science of astronomy, space, aviation, and weather,\n{ts:547} you're at the right place here on Talk Radio 77 WABC. Proud to say the Dr. Sky Experience\n{ts:554} broadcast live midnight Friday into 2:00 a.m. Saturday Eastern Daylight Time and also Saturday night, midnight into 2:00\n{ts:563} a.m. Sunday Eastern Daylight Time. And of course, as we move into the fall and the end of daylight saving time, those\n{ts:571} times will be an hour later. Naturally, check your time zones. But I saved the best for last. If you've never had an\n{ts:578} opportunity to see a decent meteor shower, mark the nights of October 20th and 21st on your calendar. And however\n{ts:586} far this particular podcast and broadcast reaches, remember that is going to be the night and the peak into... {ts:593} the morning of the 21st, that is if you're looking on the evening of the 20th after midnight, you're going\n{ts:598} naturally into the 21st. Look to the eastern sky after midnight for the constellation Orion the Hunter. We've\n{ts:606} often talked about on the Dr. Sky experience the upper left star called Beetlejuice\n{ts:611} which is a super giant star from 500 light years away. So the meteor shower Orionids come a few degrees to the left\n{ts:618} of Beetlejuice. And if you're staring at that and Orion rises, let's say a little after midnight, that's your point zero\n{ts:626} point of where these meteors are coming out. What are they from? Historically, they're from the first periodic comet\n{ts:633} ever discovered, comet Haley. Remember, we've called it mankind's comet in the past because it was the average\n{ts:640} lifetime, say 76 years. Now, we live a lot longer, thank goodness. But that comet comes around the sun every 76\n{ts:648} years. It's been doing it since days of antiquity. So if you cannot be around in 2061 or 2062 when Hal... 's returns then\n{ts:658} obviously looking for these debris particles that come from the tail of comets like comet Hy the Orionid should\n{ts:664} be good and here's why because during this particular time the moon is near new and bright moonlight is the enemy of\n{ts:672} meteor showers saying it mildly. So get set for hopeful clear skies the night of the 20th of October into the 21st. On\n{ts:680} either side of that date, you may see a few, but the peak of that shower is supposed to be early in the morning on\n{ts:687} the 21st. We're proud and ladies and gentlemen, very proud to be here on the Dr. Sky Experience on Talk Radio 77\n{ts:694} WABC. And we look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the realms of\n{ts:699} astronomy, space, aviation, and weather, and so much more. Clear skies, good health. And if you have those questions,\n{ts:707} give us a shout on an email. And also tune in to the Dr. Sky Experience. I think you'll find it quite interesting.\n{ts:714} And you can call in on the national hotline at 1 800 8489222. Clear skies.",

                "snippet": "**Sky Brown** (スカイ・ブラウン, *Sukai Buraun*; born 7 July 2008) is a British-Japanese professional skateboarder and surfer who competes for Great Britain. She was the youngest professional skateboarder in the world, and has also won the American TV programme *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*. She represented Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in the park skateboarding event, making her the country's youngest-ever medallist. She repeated this feat by winning bronze for a second time in park at the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition, she won the same event at the 2023 World Skateboarding Championship.\n\n## Early life\n\nBrown was born in Miyazaki, Japan. Her mother, Mieko, is Japanese, and her father, Stuart, is British. She has a younger brother, Ocean Brown. In Japanese, her given name is written in katakana as スカイ (Sukai) or in kanji as 澄海 (Sukai); as is standard for Japanese surnames of foreign origin, her family name is written only in katakana.\n\nHer British father lived in the United States for several years before moving to Japan. Brown lives in Miyazaki, but spends around half the year in the US. Her family are skateboarders, and her preschool had a skate park. She has a skating ramp in her back garden, as there are no skate parks in her home area of Takanabe, Miyazaki. In addition to skateboarding, Brown also surfs.... ## Skateboarding career\n\nBrown does not have a skateboarding coach; instead she learns tricks from YouTube. She sometimes practises with Shaun White, who won Olympic snowboarding medals.\n\n### 2016–2017: Early competitions\n\nIn 2016, at the age of 8, Brown took part in the Vans US Open, making her the youngest person ever to compete at the event. She fell off her skateboard in the heat. In 2017, she came second in the Asian Continental Finals, and she finished in the top 10 of the 2018 Vans Park Series.\n\n### 2018: Turning professional\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 10, Brown became a professional athlete, making her the youngest professional skateboarder in the world. The same year, she won the US TV show *Dancing with the Stars: Juniors*.\n\n### 2019: Competing for Team GB\n\nIn February 2019, she won the Simple Session event in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nIn March 2019, Brown announced that she would compete for Great Britain, having previously said that she would compete for Japan. She said that she favoured the \"more relaxed approach\" of the British Skateboarding Association. She was one of five Britons awarded funding from UK Sport that year as they worked to qualify for the skateboarding events at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the first time the sport was included in the Games.\n\nIn 2019, Brown placed 3rd in the park event at the 2019 World Skateboarding Championship in São Paulo and became the first female to land a frontside 540 at the X Games. She finished 5th at the X Games skateboarding event.... ### 2020: Training injury\n\nOn 28 May 2020, while training in California, she suffered a \"horrific\" fall from a halfpipe ramp which left her with several skull fractures and a broken left wrist and hand. She was flown to a hospital and was reported as being unresponsive on arrival. Her father said afterwards that she was \"lucky to be alive\", whilst Brown herself said it was her worst fall yet. Nevertheless, she remained determined to push boundaries and compete for gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n### 2021: X Games gold and Tokyo Olympics bronze\n\nIn July 2021, she won the X Games women's skateboarding park gold medal.\n\nBrown represented Great Britain in skateboarding at the pandemic-delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in August 2021. Brown was the youngest British Summer Olympian ever, at the age of 13, beating Margery Hinton who was 13 years and 43 days when she competed in the 200 metre breaststroke event at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Brown was not the youngest competitor at the Games — Syrian table tennis player Hend Zaza and Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki were younger.\n\nBrown won the bronze medal in the women's park skateboarding event at the 2020 Summer Olympics and became Great Britain’s youngest ever medal winner, at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She fell in her first two runs at the event and scored 56.47 in her final attempt. Brown was not the youngest medallist at the Games, as 12-year-old Cocona Hiraki of Japan won silver in the same event.\n\nIn late 2021, it was announced that some of Brown's skateboards would be displayed at the renovated Young V&A in London.... ### 2022–2023\n\nIn 2022, Brown retained her X Games title, and also won the Dew Tour event for the second year in a row. She won the park event at the World Skateboarding Championship in 2023, becoming the first British skateboarding world champion.\n\n### 2024: Paris Olympics bronze\n\nIn June 2024, Brown qualified for the park event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. She joined a team that consisted of 2022 British Champion Lola Tambling and 22-time Summer X Games medallist Andy Macdonald. This team was not only notable for their individual records, but also in the skaters' age gap, with both Tambling and Brown being 16 and Macdonald being 51 years old at the time of competing.\n\n## Surfing career\n\nIn April 2021, Brown said that she was also considering trying to compete in surfing at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, though she ultimately only competed in skateboarding.\n\nIn March 2024, she competed at the ISA World Surfing Games in Puerto Rico, in hopes of qualifying to compete in surfing at the 2024 Summer Olympics, in addition to skateboarding, but was not successful in doing so after placing 3rd in her repechage heat. She did however finish 17th of the 113 female competitors and was the highest placed British athlete across both genders.... ## Awards\n\nOn 19 December 2021, Brown won the 2021 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award; she was shortlisted again in 2022 and 2024. In April 2022, she won the Comeback of the Year award for 2021 at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nIn 2019, Brown became the youngest-ever Nike-sponsored athlete in the world. She has featured in a Nike campaign alongside Serena Williams and Simone Biles. She is also supported by Almost Skateboards and Skateistan.\n\n## Competition history\n\n### International competitions\n\n**Representing Great Britain**\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|World Championship|São Paulo, Brazil| |Park|—|\n|2021|Summer Olympics|Tokyo, Japan| |Park|—|\n|2023|World Championship|Sharjah, UAE| |Park|—|\n|2024|Summer Olympics|Paris, France| |Park|—|\n\n### Skateboarding contests\n|Year|Competition|Venue|Rank|Event|Notes|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2019|X Games|Minneapolis, Minnesota|5|Park|—|\n|2021|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|\n|2021|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|X Games|Southern California| |Park|—|\n|2022|Dew Tour|Des Moines, Iowa| |Park|—|... ## External links\n- Sky Brown at Olympics.com\n- Sky Brown at The Boardr\n- Sky Brown at SPoT\n- Sky Brown at IMDb\n\nCategories: - 2008 births\n- Living people\n- Japanese female skateboarders\n- Japanese skateboarders\n- British skateboarders\n- Japanese people of British descent\n- British people of Japanese descent\n- Japanese expatriates in the United States\n- British expatriate sportspeople in the United States\n- Skateboarders at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n- Olympic skateboarders for Great Britain\n- Olympic medalists in skateboarding\n- Medalists at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n- Medalists at the 2024 Summer Olympics\n- Olympic bronze medallists for Great Britain\n- X Games competitors\n- Sportspeople from Miyazaki (city)\n- World Skateboarding Championship medalists\n- British children\n- Japanese children\n- Skateboarders at the 2024 Summer Olympics\n- 21st-century Japanese sportswomen\n- Child sportspeople",

Now, the Saudi Cup was important because that's the race that rodic Warrior, of course. So, this went beyond that. Incredible. Here's the race. Darren Flynnel's call of the 2025 20 million Tab Everest\n{ts:341} and we're just about ready to run to the roar of a youthful crowd and they're off in the tab Everest. An overpass begin fast as expected. Caying risings right there and now Mazu is whipping up underneath the pair. Lady Shannondal has got a great spot fourth in front of\n{ts:359} Tempted. Further back to Jolly Star. They're followed then by Jimmy Star is going forward from the wide drawer. Brias's got back in the field followed then by Angel Capital. Jedial and Magic Time. Mazu shows the way. Overpass sits on the outside. Caryang rising two\n{ts:376} lengths away. Third is trucking along and Jimmy keeps him company. Jimmy Star up on the outside followed by Tempted. Lady Shannondoa and Jolly Star gets great cover turning for home. Marzu in front from over pass. Caying rising two lengths away. Then Jimmy Star clear from... $150 with any confidence whatsoever, even though he got to even money. So, in the space between October\n{ts:498} 7 and October 18, David Hayes has elevated that horse, not even back to his best, but back to a a point where he can do this. Yeah, he's just incredible. Um he and he and I wasn't at the trial, but I the vision I\n{ts:515} saw of him at the trial walking around, he was hot, he was bothered. Uh he's just And you know, everyone tells me that he's never trled bad in Hong Kong. So, it was it was a one-off that really well, it even I think it's even scared Zack. He said, \"Well, there's room for improvement.\" I'm sure I'm I'm sure of\n{ts:534} that. Well, you could tell Ronnie, like I said in that interview on Friday that I done with Zach, like he was concerned like and not only about the horse, but about the track conditions as well. Like they were obviously a bit worried and the surface, all the little things that I said, \"Oh, does it bother you?\" He said, \"Yes, it does.\"\n{ts:550} normally Zach would go the other way, you know, and he... {ts:904} line I got to give it to Brown Ethan Brown as well he had a crack at given given it to Zach there but he just wasn't fast enough on the right horse let's talk about David Hayes and um the way he has embraced this journey for everyone uh even when He said, \"I want to take\n{ts:923} Kaying Rising away from the crowd to saddle him up because I think that's what we need to do to have him right.\" He also said, \"But I still want to show him off to the crowd. I still want him to parade. I want everyone to have a look at him and then we'll move him out the back and then we'll saddle him up.\" After he\n{ts:940} settled up, he came back out into that pre- parade and we got another look at him.... {ts:1347} I was I was very happy to see him sit down with you on the Friday. you did a long interview with him which we played on the morning of the Everest and how relaxed he was and how open he was to to still talk about something that he's been talking about for weeks and weeks and weeks. Uh surely he was looking forward to the talk being over and just getting out\n{ts:1364} there and doing it. But he sat down, he was relaxed and he gave you that interview to talk about what he thought of the day coming up tomorrow. Yeah. And like I said, Rads, like with all that pressure, not just all the money and you know, like, but that big buildup, like I said, it's it's a lot of pressure and that\n{ts:1383} those BS like Zack and Huey and even Lukie Nolan for that matter, you know, like to handle that pressure, I'm not even sure I'd be able to do it. You know what I mean? Like he could quite often panic. Like even though he's a front running horse, when he jumped, he jumped well. Obviously overpass outside Mazu underneath him. You watch the overhead shot and he just gives it... 's coming back to scale now. Will you be back? Will you be back next year? Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. Don't you worry about that. And we'll get that Twitter guy out of my life and it'll be\n{ts:1627} good fun. Good on you, David. Oh, that Twitter guy. Now, that was the fake news moment. That was the fake news moment. Oh, yeah, baby. He's coming back. So, actually before we move on, have you got the tab Everest market? Let's have the first ladies and gentlemen, here it is. The first market\n{ts:1646} we're going to show you for next year's Everest. I don't keep count how many times we show you this between now and October, whatever, next year. They put up 250 yesterday. They put up 250. Oh, no. He's into 225 already. No. Well, they get their money back if he doesn't come.\n{ts:1666} Back. I think he's coming. Bay Jimmy Jolie. Well, we're just rehashing the the beaten brigade that the two incoming a Bay and Autumn Glow. We'll see what happens. They don't think Tempted went any good yesterday. Well, she... s done 60 interviews this week of probably which 45 or 50 of them were over that\n{ts:1946} conjecture. So, you know, we thought it was funny at first, like, oh, how stupid. And then when it sort of uh took hold and everyone was ringing us from stewards to, you know, the CEO of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, it was just like, guys, this is just a, you know, this is\n{ts:1964} just a hack. So, anyway, you David said a couple of days ago and he said, I thought I'd seen everything in racing. I haven't. So we uh I arrived last Saturday at Rose Hill Gardens and Ronnie said to me, \"This horse is on the first plane back to Hong Kong if these reports are right.\n{ts:1982} It started I mean it really heated up on Sunday but it was talked it was happened on Friday night.\" Yeah, it was going Friday afternoon into the night from all sorts of sources. So it spread like a bush fire and you know what it likes with rumors, they get bigger and bigger and bigger and someone puts their own top spin on it and they've got him, you know, in... 's just playing unbelievably well. You know, maybe the fence wasn't the place to be yesterday if you want to nitpick, but that's that's no problem whatsoever. It's a big track. It's probably better really. It makes them fan and carry on. A few Well, but I don't think we had a leader win all day.\n{ts:2201} Yeah. Uh so hard to lead and win. And Rody, it it makes it even better the job that Michael Wood and Dave Anderson have done with the track because they haven't had the rain. They've had to water it. Yeah. Yeah. And they and and sometimes that can be dangerous and they've got the watering right.\n{ts:2218} That's what I reckon. And then Tim walks the tracks. I listen to Tim. He's a very He's got all the figures. Tim Ryan. Yep. And he says and I agree that they have just the they've got the watering down pat. They're not watering tracks down to start off on soft fives. They you can\n{ts:2235} get so much wrong doing that. Yes. They just put enough in there slowly slowly. I know they've had the weather and we've had rain at the right time of the week all mostly. Mostly yes. But it worked out perfect there on the weekend. Like I was talking to Michael Wood like they considering putting one... 's definitely a PB. Even though he's, you know, in the in the book, he's finished fourth, but that he just run out of his skin there on Saturday. So, as it turned out, it wasn't a bad trial. It was a good trial for everything. It was a nice trial.\n{ts:2392} Well, offline car Ying Mr. Bright Side just got nutted out. It's been a great try. Well, the quote from John O'",

With no concrete discussions underway between congreesional Republicans and Democrats, the federal government shutdown will enter its fourth week on Wednesday with no end in sight.\n\n##### NCAI Strongly Condemns Large-Scale Federal Layoffs Harming Tribal Programs\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) strongly condemns the large-scale reductions in force (RIFs) purportedly resulting from the ongoing government shutdown, which disproportionately impact Tribal programs — particularly those supporting health care, housing, economic development, and education in Native communities.\n\n**Never miss Indian Country’s biggest stories and breaking news.**Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\n\n\"Targeting people who manage and support programs that are the backbone of Tribal communities — our health, our homes, our economic futures, and our children's education — is not just short-sighted, it's an abdication of the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations,\" said NCAI Executive Director Larry Wright, Jr. \"Our communities are not expendable. These actions are a betrayal of the promises made to Tribal Nations, and we will not remain silent as the very infrastructure of our future is dismantled.\"\n\n###### CMS Hosts All Tribes Webinar on the Rural Health Transformation Program\n\nLast week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) hosted an All Tribes Webinar on the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). The RHTP was authorized by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and will invest $50 billion into improving rural health care over the next five years.\n\nThe National Indian Health Board (NIHB) hosted a Tribal caucus to help Tribal leaders, health experts, Tribal organizations, and health professionals prepare for the webinar. During the Tribal caucus, NIHB provided an overview of the RHTP and analyzed its Tribal impacts. You can find the caucus presentation slides here.\n\nTo follow up after the webinar, CMS Division of Tribal Affairs (DTA) circulated the presentation slides.... ##### Medicare Open Enrollment is Underway\n\nMedicare Open Enrollment runs from October 15 through December 7. During this period, beneficiaries can review and make changes to their Medicare coverage for 2026, including switching plans or updating prescription drug coverage. Although under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), special enrollment periods have been changed, members of federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Corporation shareholder can still enroll year-round. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to compare options and ensure their plan meets their current health needs. The changes made during Open Enrollment are effective January 1 of next year. Read about your options and find more information here.\n\n##### Federal Government Goes Paperless for Payments\n\nStarting Sept. 30, the federal government went paperless, which means most federal payments that were made by paper check—including Social Security benefits and tax refunds—will be made electronically.\n\nThe change came as a result of Executive Order (EO) 14247 “Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account” that was signed on March 25, 2024 by President Trump.\n\nIn order to promote public awareness of the Federal Government’s shift to secure electronic payments, the Department of the Treasury has created a new resource page related to EO 14247 at MyMoney.gov/FederalPayments.\n\nThe new page features frequently asked questions about the EO, directions for signing up for electronic payments, and Federal agency contact information where payment recipients can learn more or get help.... #### More Stories Like ThisNative News Weekly (August 25, 2024): D.C.

Yet across tribal communities, innovative leaders are fighting back, reclaiming traditional food systems and breathing new life into Native languages. These aren't just cultural preservation efforts—they're powerful pathways to community health, healing, and resilience.\n\nOur dedicated reporting team will spend three years documenting these stories through on-the-ground reporting in 18 tribal communities, producing over 200 in-depth stories, 18 podcast episodes, and multimedia content that amplifies Indigenous voices. We'll show policymakers, funders, and allies how cultural restoration directly impacts physical and mental wellness while celebrating successful models of sovereignty and self-determination.\n\nThis isn't corporate media parachuting into Indian Country for a quick story. This is sustained, relationship-based journalism by Native reporters who understand these communities. It's \"Warrior Journalism\"—fearless reporting that serves the 5.5 million readers who depend on us for news that mainstream media often ignores.\n\n**We need your help right now.** While we've secured partial funding, we're still $450,000 short of our three-year budget. Our immediate goal is $25,000 this month to keep this critical work moving forward—funding reporter salaries, travel to remote communities, photography, and the deep reporting these stories deserve.\n\nEvery dollar directly supports Indigenous journalists telling Indigenous stories. Whether it's $5 or $50, your contribution ensures these vital narratives of resilience, innovation, and hope don't disappear into silence.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. Native languages are being lost at an alarming rate. Food insecurity plagues many tribal communities. But solutions are emerging, and these stories need to be told.\n\n*Support independent Native journalism. Fund the stories that matter.*\n\nLevi Rickert (Potawatomi), Editor & Publisher",
