              "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

              "snippet": "# Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow\n\nFive months ago, we introduced Flow, our AI filmmaking tool powered by Veo, and have been inspired by the creativity it has sparked with over 275 million videos generated in Flow\n\n1\n\n. We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

              "snippet": "# Meet Flow: AI-powered filmmaking with Veo 3\n\nToday we’re introducing Flow, our new AI filmmaking tool.\n\nIt’s built by and for creatives, and it’s the only AI filmmaking tool custom-designed for Google’s most advanced models — Veo, Imagen and Gemini. Flow can help storytellers explore their ideas without bounds and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. It’s early days, and we’re excited to shape the future of Flow with creatives and filmmakers.\n\n### What’s possible with Flow\n\nFlow is inspired by what it feels like when time slows down and creation is effortless, iterative and full of possibility. It’s custom-designed for Veo, Google’s state-of-the-art generative video model, with exceptional prompt adherence and stunning cinematic outputs that excel at physics and realism. Behind the scenes, Gemini models make prompting intuitive, so you can describe your vision in everyday language. You can bring your own assets to create characters, or use Flow to make your own ingredients with Imagen’s text-to-image capabilities.\n\nOnce you’ve created a subject or a scene, you can integrate those same ingredients into different clips and scenes with consistency. Or you can use a scene image to start a new shot.\n\nCreate your ingredients\n\nUse those ingredients to create a clip\n\nReference ingredients in plain language... ### Key features to unlock your storytelling\n\nFlow also comes with a range of features for professionals or those just getting started:\n\n**Camera Controls:**Master your shot with direct control over camera motion, angles and perspectives. **Scenebuilder:**Seamlessly edit and extend your existing shots — revealing more of the action or transitioning to what happens next with continuous motion and consistent characters. **Asset Management:**Easily manage and organize all of your ingredients and prompts. **Flow TV** **:**Spark your creativity with an ever-growing showcase of clips, channels, and content generated with Veo. You can see the exact prompts and techniques used for clips you like, providing a practical way to learn and adapt new styles.\n\nSeamless transitions\n\nCamera controls\n\nCinematic quality\n\n### Get started with Flow\n\nFlow is the evolution of VideoFX, a Google Labs experiment that launched last year. Starting today, Flow is available to subscribers of our Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra plans in the U.S., with more countries coming soon.\n\nGoogle AI Pro gives you the key Flow features and 100 generations per month, and Google AI Ultra gives you the highest usage limits and early access to Veo 3 with native audio generation, bringing environmental sounds and character dialogue directly into video creation.... ### How we’re collaborating with filmmakers\n\nAs with any groundbreaking technology, we’re still understanding the full potential of AI in filmmaking. We see the emergence of these tools as an enabler, helping a new wave of filmmakers more easily tell their stories. By offering filmmakers early access to Flow, we were able to better understand how our technology could best support and integrate into their creative workflows — and we’ve woven their insights into Flow. Here are some filmmakers we partnered with and the short films they developed using Flow along with other tools and techniques.\n\n**Dave Clark**\n\nDave is an award-winning filmmaker focused on embracing new technology as part of his filmmaking. He used AI to develop two of his most recent short films, “Battalion” and “NinjaPunk.” His newest short film “Freelancers” uses Google’s AI and other tools to tell the story of two estranged adopted brothers on similar quests.\n\n**Henry Daubrez**\n\nHenry has been using tech tools in his art for the last 18 years. Earlier this year he unveiled “Kitsune” using Veo 2 — a moving short film about “love between two souls separated by everything except their shared feelings of loneliness.” Now, Henry is bringing the story of his own creative journey to life in “Electric Pink.”\n\n**Junie Lau**\n\nJunie Lau is a film director and multidisciplinary creative deeply passionate about innovation, viewing AI as a vital collaborator in expanding the boundaries of creative expression. Her work delves into artistic narratives within the hyper-modern era, including themes of virtual identity, digital humanities and digital ontology. Currently, Junie is working on a film titled “Dear Stranger,” which explores the boundless and infinite nature of universal love between a grandmother and grandchild across countless parallel worlds.\n\nAI is ushering in a new chapter of creativity and filmmaking, and while it’s still early, we see so much potential for tools like Flow to unlock new voices and creations.\n\nFor more insights on Flow and how AI helps storytellers take more risks in the creative storytelling process, watch Dave Clark, Junie Lau, and Henry Daubrez in \"Behind the Lens: AI, Creativity, and the Future of Filmmaking Tools.\"",

These new models are available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Veo 3.1 is also available in the Gemini app and Flow.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast empower developers to create more engaging content through significant upgrades. The models now generate\n\n**richer native audio**, from natural conversations to synchronized sound effects, and offer **greater narrative control** with an improved understanding of cinematic styles. **Enhanced image-to-video** capabilities ensure better prompt adherence while delivering superior audio and visual quality and maintaining character consistency across multiple scenes.\n\nIn addition to the model update, we are introducing new model capabilities, including using reference images to guide video generation, extend existing Veo videos, and generate transitions between a first and last frame.\n\nYou can now guide the generation process by providing up to 3 reference images of a character, object, or scene. This is helpful for maintaining character consistency across multiple shots or applying a specific style to your video.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nreference_images=[reference_image1, reference_image2],\n\n),\n\n\n\n```... Your story is no longer limited by the original generation. With Scene extension, you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, by generating new clips that connect to your previous video. Each new video is generated based on the final second of the previous clip. This maintains visual continuity, making the feature ideal for extending shots with background audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nvideo=video_to_extend\n\n\n\n```\n\nCreate smooth, natural scenes that bridge two different images. By providing a starting and an ending image, you can direct Veo 3.1 to generate the transition between them, complete with accompanying audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nimage=first_frame,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nlast_frame=last_frame,\n\n),\n\n\n\n```\n\n**What people are building with Veo 3.1**\n\nPromise Studios, a GenAI movie studio, uses Veo 3.1 within its MUSE Platform to enhance generative storyboarding and previsualization for director-driven storytelling at production quality.... Latitude is experimenting with Veo 3.1 in its generative narrative engine to instantly bring user-created stories to life.\n\nVeo 3.1 and these new capabilities are now available in paid preview via the Gemini API.\n\nVeo 3.1 is the same price as Veo 3.

              "snippet": "# Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow\n\nFive months ago, we introduced Flow, our AI filmmaking tool powered by Veo, and have been inspired by the creativity it has sparked with over 275 million videos generated in Flow\n\n1\n\n. We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

The image-to-video capability benefits from improved audio-visual quality and better follows your prompt.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast are available in the Gemini app, as well as the Gemini API and Vertex AI, to power text-to-video and image-to-video for horizontal (16×9) and vertical (9×16) outputs.\n\nMeanwhile, Google is updating the Flow filmmaking tool to take advantage of Veo 3.1. Audio generation is coming to:\n\n**Ingredients to Video**: This can include images of multiple characters, objects, and styles **Scene extension**: You can Extend an existing clip, with Google basing it on the last second **Frames to Video**: This lets you specify the starting and ending images, with Flow bridging the two\n\nFlow is getting new editing capabilities. You can insert elements like objects, characters, and details, with Google handling shadows, scene lighting, and other complex details to make everything look natural.\n\nComing soon is the ability to remove objects and characters from a scene, with Flow working to reconstruct the background and surroundings to make the edit seamless.\n\n\n\n## Comments",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

              "snippet": "If you’ve seen short, cinematic clips made “from a prompt” and wondered how it works, you’re in the right place. This guide will walk you through Google’s latest video generation model, Veo 3.1, in plain English—what it is, why it matters, where you can try it, and a simple first project you can finish in about 10 minutes. Don’t worry if you’ve never touched AI video before. We’ll move step by step and flag common gotchas so you can avoid them.\n\n## What is Google Veo 3.1?\n\nGoogle Veo 3.1 is a text-to-video AI model that turns short written prompts and references into short video clips, with native audio support and more control over storytelling and style. In October 2025, Google announced Veo 3.1 (and a faster variant) in paid preview for developers and creators. According to the Google Developers Blog announcement (Oct 15, 2025), Veo 3.1 is available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and it adds richer native audio, improved adherence to cinematic styles, and new creative controls.\n\nWhy it matters for beginners: Veo 3.1’s improvements make it easier to describe the mood and motion you want—like “a slow dolly-in on a vintage typewriter with soft rain ambience”—and actually get something close, without wrestling with advanced settings.... ## What’s new compared to earlier Veo versions?\n\nGoogle calls out a few key upgrades in Veo 3.1:\n\n- Richer native audio generation and better narrative control, with improved understanding of cinematic styles (publisher: Google; see the Developers Blog announcement (2025)).\n\n- New creative tools in supporting apps: you can guide generation with multiple reference images, extend existing Veo clips, or bridge between a first and last frame to create transitions. These capabilities are highlighted in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (Oct 2025).\n\n- Native audio emphasis and model positioning are also described on the DeepMind Veo model page, which introduces Veo’s “video, meet audio” concept.\n\nIndependent coverage, like TechCrunch’s report on the Veo 3.1 release (Oct 2025), provides context on rollout and app integration. For hard limits (length, resolution), always defer to Google’s official docs, as those details can change.\n\n## Where can you use Veo 3.1 today?\n\nAs of October 2025:\n\n- Flow (Google’s AI video editor): Google’s announcement notes Veo 3.1 and advanced creative controls in Flow, including “Ingredients to Video” (use multiple images as style/character references), “Frames to Video” (bridge between start/end frames), and “Extend” (lengthen a clip). Details are outlined in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (2025).\n\n- Gemini API (Google AI Studio and Vertex AI): Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast are in paid preview via the Gemini API, per the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\nImportant: Access tiers, regions, and pricing can vary and may change. If you’re not seeing options in your account, check Google’s documentation or support for your account type and region.... ## What can Veo 3.1 generate right now? (Practical limits to know)\n\n- In Vertex AI’s preview for Veo 3.1 base generations, the documented lengths are currently short (choose 4, 6, or 8 seconds). This is specified on the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview page.\n\n- In Gemini API extension workflows, you can extend Veo-generated clips. The API docs describe a maximum of up to 141 seconds for input Veo videos in those extension scenarios, with 720p listed in that context. See the Gemini API video documentation (Google).\n\nThese numbers help set expectations: start with short shots, then extend or chain shots together. Avoid assuming 1080p or minute-long base generations unless Google’s official docs explicitly state it for your environment.... ## A 10-minute quickstart: your first Veo 3.1 clip\n\nWe’ll make a simple “coffee shop mood” shot you can adapt for social posts.\n\n- Choose your aspect ratio\n\n- 16:9 (landscape) for YouTube and desktop-first screens\n\n- 9:16 (vertical) for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts Pick one at the start to avoid accidental cropping later.\n\n- Write a clear, concrete prompt Use this structure to get reliable results: subject + action + setting + style + camera + audio.\n\n- Example prompt: “A barista gently places a ceramic cup on a wooden counter; shallow depth of field; warm morning light streaming through windows; slow dolly-in; subtle steam rising; soft cafe ambience, no dialogue, light jazz in the background.”\n\nIf you want a deeper primer on prompt structure and clarity, see these prompt engineering best practices for beginners.\n\n- Generate in your chosen interface\n\n- In Flow: Start a new project, choose Veo 3.1, paste your prompt, set aspect ratio, and generate.\n\n- In Gemini API/Vertex AI: Use the model/version and parameters documented for Veo 3.1 in your environment. Begin with short durations and default settings.\n\n- Review the output like a director\n\n- Does the subject and action match? Is the lighting/mood close?\n\n- Is the camera movement smooth? Is audio what you expected?\n\n- Make one or two changes per iteration—small edits beat big rewrites.\n\n- Refine with controls\n\n- Reference images: If you want consistency (e.g., the same mug or barista style), use up to three reference images to guide the look. This capability is described in Google’s announcements (2025).\n\n- Frames to Video: Provide a starting and ending frame to shape the motion between them.\n\n- Extend: Lengthen your favorite moment to create a longer beat.\n\n- Export Choose the format/aspect ratio you started with. If you need both vertical and horizontal versions, plan to reframe or regenerate with the other aspect ratio rather than cropping aggressively.... ## A practical planning example using Skywork AI (optional, 5 minutes)\n\nSkywork AI can help you prepare the words before you ever hit “Generate.” Disclosure: Skywork AI is our product.\n\nHere’s a neutral, step-by-step way to use it purely for planning:\n\n- Open Skywork and create a new document. Ask for a short video outline: “30-second coffee shop mood piece: 3 shots, warm tone, slow camera.”\n\n- Have it draft a compact shot list with camera moves and audio notes, like:\n\n- Close-up of cup; slow dolly-in; soft steam; light jazz; no dialogue\n\n- Medium barista hands; gentle rack focus; cafe ambience; espresso hiss\n\n- Wide room tone; sunbeams; slow tilt up; footsteps and cups\n\n- Ask for a final prompt assembled from the shot you want to generate first. Copy that prompt into Veo 3.1.\n\nIf you prefer to outline prompts and story beats yourself, this short guide to Skywork’s General Mode for planning and outlining walks through a simple, distraction-free workflow.... ## FAQs for first-time users\n\n\n\nIs Veo 3.1 free? No. Google describes Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast as being in paid preview via the Gemini API as of October 2025. See the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025). Pricing varies by product and usage.\n\n\n\nWhere can I try Veo 3.1? Flow (for a visual editor), and the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI (for developers). Google outlines these options in the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025) and the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nHow long can my video be? It depends on the environment and workflow. In Vertex AI’s Veo 3.1 preview, base generations are short (4, 6, or 8 seconds). In Gemini API extension workflows, input Veo videos can be extended up to 141 seconds. See the Vertex AI preview page and the Gemini API video docs.\n\n\n\nWhat resolutions are supported? The Gemini API documentation for extension workflows references 720p in that context. Official materials do not universally guarantee 1080p for base Veo 3.1 generations at this time.\n\n\n\nCan I keep a character or object consistent across shots? Yes. Google notes you can guide Veo 3.1 with up to three reference images for a character, object, or scene. This is described in the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nCan I add my own audio and sync it? Veo 3.1 focuses on native audio generation controlled via your prompt. The public pages cited here do not detail a full “upload and auto-sync” workflow, so avoid relying on that unless you see it documented for your account.... ## Next steps\n\n- Try a tiny project: one 6–8 second shot with a clear prompt. If you like the result, use “Extend” or stitch a second shot with “Frames to Video.”\n\n- Build a simple storyboard first. If you want help outlining ideas, you can use Skywork AI to draft prompts and shot lists before you generate. Keep it simple: one scene, one action, one camera move.\n\n- When you’re ready to go deeper, explore Google’s official resources: the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025), the Developers Blog announcement (2025), the DeepMind Veo overview, the Gemini API video docs, and the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview.\n\nYou don’t need special “artistic talent” to start—just one clear sentence and a little patience.

Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate.

Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject.

We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Data-driven feedback and strategies. None of this guessing garbage people put on online teaching you how to do YouTube.... {ts:0} So, Google Labs just had an update and it's technically called Flow. It's on\n{ts:4} their labs.google platform and you can see by the beginning of this video that it does still need some work, but you\n{ts:9} haven't been able to do that recently with Google Labs. And now you can do it with Google's Vo3. So, there's been a\n{ts:15} couple updates here that you can see. And the first one here is using images or allowing images to talk with Google's\n{ts:20} VO3, which again still needs some work, but look, it gets maybe 60% of the way there. I think it looks pretty decent.\n{ts:29} I'm obviously not going to use it to try and convince people that it's real, but maybe you can get kind of creative with\n{ts:34} this and get people to make some really funny, strange, or just dumb things that people love. I don't know why people\n{ts:42} just love brain rot these days. Now, they're also adding the option to do this with V V3 on frames to video, which\n{ts:49} is actually kind of cool. And they... 're also allowing you to top up your subscription with the kind of a mid tier\n{ts:56} option cuz previously they had just the the starter which was about 20 bucks or so per month in the US and then it was\n{ts:63} straight up to I think 250 without the discount for the first 3 months and there's just no in between. It's just a\n{ts:70} massive jump. So they added like a kind of a mid tier there. I think a couple too. Well, I'll show you what that looks\n{ts:75} like and you can top up your credits there as well. They've also gone ahead and just added better audio coverage,\n{ts:83} which I haven't really noticed all that much to be honest. Right now, there's not a huge difference as at least a\n{ts:89} noticeable difference in my opinion from me using it. Um, they also do remove audio when miners are involved. Keep\n{ts:96} that in mind. That's why your audio isn't being generated if you have kids in the video or maybe uh even teenagers\n{ts:101} sometimes. Um, but then there's also they've mentioned they're reducing um unwanted subtitles, which is actually... {ts:107} quite nice. They've been removing the the VEO watermark as well, but now they said they've reduced the unwanted\n{ts:114} subtitles. I still get them sometimes. So, I literally in caps specify in the prompt to not include captions because\n{ts:121} otherwise if I don't, sometimes the captions still show up. And the really nice quality of life update they've made\n{ts:127} here is that when you are just starting a new project or revisiting an existing one, it doesn't reset the model that you\n{ts:135} have, or at least if it does, it resets to the VO3 fast beta audio. So, this is where you're generating audio. So now\n{ts:142} you don't accidentally have VO2 selected with no audio every time you either reload a page, start a new project, or\n{ts:150} you leave and come back and it's been reset to just its default VO2. Now it's actually its default is V3 fast beta\n{ts:157} audio. So the 20 credits per generation, the cheaper VO3 option with audio. So now you don't accidentally generate\n{ts:164} videos without audio, which has happened a lot to me and I... 've wasted thousands of credits doing that by accident. So,\n{ts:171} great update right there. Quality of life, which you don't have to waste any more credits. Now, now let's say that\n{ts:176} you don't want to spend the $124 per month, and this is for the first 3 months. Then, it goes to 150, I believe,\n{ts:183} per month. So, I'm probably going to cancel it at that point because that's just really expensive, at least using\n{ts:189} VO3. Now you have the option if you have the uh let's see which was it the pro subscription the $20 a month\n{ts:195} subscription right here Google AI pro you still get a th000 credits per month in uh Google labs but you also have the\n{ts:204} option to top up your credits so for example in here when you're creating your AI videos if you run out of credits\n{ts:211} like here you can just hit get more AI credits and you can choose how much you want to add so you don't have to spend\n{ts:216} $200 or $150 at a time you could spend an extra for 24 bucks that month just to top up your credits. This wasn... 't\n{ts:223} available in the lower plans. It was only available in the the maximum ultra tier. So, I really like the ability to\n{ts:230} do that now. So, you don't have to spend so much all at once, especially if you're not using all your credits at the\n{ts:235} end of each month, but maybe one month you're just out and you need to add more, you can do so and add some\n{ts:240} credits, which is actually quite nice. I've hit this button a little too much recently, but uh hey, I'm getting good\n{ts:247} results. So, those are all the current updates with Google's Veo3 with their labs platform. Hope to see you in the\n{ts:253} next one.",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

Let me share a secret with you.\n{ts:5} I am your new girlfriend. Google just surprised everyone. VO 3.1 is officially live today. It's faster,\n{ts:22} smarter, and now generates full cinematic clips with sound. And yeah, I've already got access. Let me show you\n{ts:30} how crazy this is. So, here's the thing. VO3.1 isn't available everywhere just yet. Right now, it's rolling out only\n{ts:39} inside Google Flow. So, if you already have a Google AI account, you can access it right from there. I'm already logged\n{ts:46} in and as you can see, the VO3.1 fast model is live. So, yeah, no fake claims here. This is real and I've been talking\n{ts:55} about this since my earlier videos. Now using it is simple. Write your prompt. Select VO3.1 fast. Hit generate. That's\n{ts:65} it. No complex settings, no extra steps. All right, let's talk about what's actually\n{ts:79} new in VO3.1. This update isn't a total overhaul. It... 's more like a smarter, cleaner upgrade to\n{ts:87} V3. Here's what's changed. One, smarter scene creation. You can now combine reference images, locations, characters,\n{ts:96} and objects, and VO automatically builds a cohesive scene around them. No more weird lighting mismatches or random jump\n{ts:104} cuts. Two, built-in sound generation. Every clip now includes matching audio, ambient sounds, dialogue, or effects\n{ts:113} that sync perfectly with the visuals. It makes your videos feel far more cinematic and alive. Three, clip\n{ts:121} extension. You can take a short clip and expand it into a full cinematic sequence. VO keeps the same lighting,\n{ts:129} motion, and audio flow seamlessly. It's perfect for trailers, ads, or storydriven projects. Four, custom start\n{ts:138} and end control. Now you can choose where a shot begins and ends, and VO fills in the middle with smooth,\n{ts:145} realistic transitions that gives you more storytelling control. Five, add or remove elements. Want to remove an\n{ts:153} object or drop in a new one? Just select it. VO automatically adjusts lighting, shadows, and scale to keep everything... {ts:161} realistic. Six, higher realism and physics accuracy. Scenes now behave like real life. Lighting looks natural,\n{ts:170} character movement feels grounded, and the visuals have that cinematic finish. You'll also notice image to video\n{ts:176} generation looks a lot cleaner now. Frames are stable, colors look balanced, and it feels much closer to real\n{ts:183} footage. That said, it still can't generate long videos yet. The maximum I've seen is around 8 seconds. So don't\n{ts:191} expect 1 minute clips for now. So yeah, not a massive reinvention, but a much smarter, smoother version of what VO\n{ts:198} already did well. I'll be testing this more and posting sideby-side comparisons soon. Stay tuned to see how it compares\n{ts:205} to VO3. If this video helped you, hit like, share it with your tech buddies, and make sure you subscribe for more AI\n{ts:212} updates like this.

We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

It said that Veo 3.1 builds on May's Veo 3 release and generates more realistic clips and adheres to prompts better.\nThe model allows users to add an object to the video and have it blend into the clip's style, Google said. Soon, users will be able to remove an existing object from the video in Flow, too.\nVeo 3 already has edit features such as adding reference images to drive a character, providing the first and last frame to generate a clip using AI, and the ability to extend an existing video based on the last few frames. With Veo 3.1, Google is adding audio to all these features to make the clips more lively.\nThe company is rolling out the model to its video editor Flow, the Gemini App, along with Vertex and Gemini APIs. It said that since Flow's launch in May, users have created more than 275 million videos on the app.",

You’ll watch me bounce between Gemini and the pro-grade Flow interface, learn my Prompt-Director Formula for nailing subject, action, context, motion, style, framing & audio, and see three crowd-pleasing demos in action. I’ll also flag the sneaky differences between Veo 3.1 Fast  and full Veo 3.1 Quality, share quick wins like borrowing Midjourney stills for style reference, and spotlight.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 – Why Veo 3 matters\n0:41 Flow vs Gemini\n2:11 Example #1\n4:23 The VEO3 Prompt Formula\n11:25 Example #2\n15:26 Example #3\n17:38 Wrapping up... {ts:0} Hey guys, I need a photo of AI master. Do you know who is AI master?\n{ts:5} Make Death Star great again. Okay. Oh, today I'm pulling back the curtain on\n{ts:10} Google's new VO3, the next gen AI video model that's got me acting like a kid in a tech toy store. We're talking text to\n{ts:18} video. You type a description and VO3 spits out an 8second video clip with sound. Yes, audio and video from just\n{ts:26} your words. [Music] In this tutorial, I'll show you how to\n{ts:31} harness VO3 to create funny viral style videos like this. It's just a few toasters, right? What's\n{ts:38} the worst that could happen? The big deal here is native audio. Unlike earlier models, VO3 doesn't just\n{ts:46} create silent clips. It also produces sound effects, background noise, even character dialogue to match. Each clip\n{ts:52} is limited to about 8 seconds for now, so we're talking short form content. They left behind a a ball today. It\n{ts:60} bounced higher than I can jump. What manner of magic is that? Now, Google gives us two main ways to... {ts:67} use V3. Flow and Gemini. Think of them as two different cameras that use the same film. Google Flow is like a pro\n{ts:75} filmmaking tool built around V3. It's a dedicated interface currently on Google apps where you can storyboard scenes,\n{ts:82} manage assets, tweak camera moves, the works. Flow was literally customd designed for VO. Lets you do fancy\n{ts:89} things. Upload or generate ingredients like character images via image genen and reuse them in multiple shots for\n{ts:96} consistency. Control camera angles and motion paths manually and even uses scene builder to extend the clips\n{ts:102} seamlessly into the next part of the story. It's basically an AI video studio for filmmakers. Now, Flow isn't open to\n{ts:109} everyone by default. It's available if you have a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription in certain regions. Pro\n{ts:116} subscribers get most flow features, but only the ultra tier unlocks V3 fully. If you are on Pro, you have something\n{ts:123} called VO3 fast speed optimized version with sound slightly lower quality. I'll talk about that in a sec.\n{ts:132} All right, this idea cracks me up. A grandma skydiving into the Super Bowl. Talk about a stun granny. Let... {ts:276} I always try to include. Subject, who or what is in the scene, action, what the subject is doing. Context, setting,\n{ts:284} where and when is this happening. Motion, camera and movement, how the scene is shot and moves. Style, the\n{ts:291} visual style or genre. framing, composition, how the shot is framed, and constraints, extras, any additional\n{ts:298} details or instructions. And don't forget audio. VO3 will generate sound to match your scene, but only if you tell\n{ts:305} it what you want to hear. So, I often append an audio double colon section in the prompt describing sound effects,\n{ts:312} background noise, or dialogue lines. For example, audio double colon crowd cheering, upbeat rock music playing\n{ts:319} faintly, or character says hello world. You can specify dialogue explicitly, word for word, or implicitly, like a man\n{ts:327} introduces himself and let the AI make up the words. If you ask for dialogue, add no subtitles to your prompt.\n{ts:334} Otherwise, the model might plaster autogenerated subtitles on the video, which look well, not great. We... 'll see\n{ts:340} that in action soon. A boring prompt like a man answers a phone might yield a bland clip. But a richly detailed prompt\n{ts:348} can produce something cinematic. For instance, check this out. Basic prompt. A man answers a rotary phone.\n{ts:356} Hello. And detailed prompt. A shaky dolly zoom goes from a faraway\n{ts:364} blur to a close-up cinematic shot of a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he picks up a rotary\n{ts:370} phone mounted on a gritty brick wall. Bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign. The zoom reveals the tension on\n{ts:377} his face as he struggles to speak. shallow depth of field keeps focus on his furrowed brow and the phone, while\n{ts:384} the background is a blur of neon colors and shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation.\n{ts:392} I I have to Which one would you rather watch? The\n{ts:400} second prompt, nail subject, action, context, motion, that dolly zoom, style, cinematic, neon, noir, vibes, framing,\n{ts:408} close-up, ambience, eerie, neon, glow, all the elements. VO3 will follow the detailed prompt much more faithfully... {ts:416} than a vague one, yielding a dramatic video instead of a random guy on a phone. Bottom line, be specific and\n{ts:423} vivid. Describe what the camera sees and what the mic hears. Now, coming up with such detailed prompt can feel like\n{ts:429} flexing a new muscle. Here's where I cheat a little. I use Chad GBT to help refine prompt. Sometimes I'll start with\n{ts:436} a simple idea, say grandma's skydiving into stadium, and ask Chad GBT to describe the scene in a funny cinematic\n{ts:445} way with sights and sounds. The AI will usually output a nicely embellished description that I can copy or tweak for\n{ts:452} VO. Similarly, I use Smidjourney for visual prototyping. I'll feed a quick version of my idea to Midjourney to get\n{ts:459} a still image that helps me visualize the color palette or style I want. Maybe I like how it looks as a 1980s cartoon\n{ts:467} versus a gritty realistic photo and I can then describe that style in my VO prompt. This extra step isn't required,\n{ts:476} but if you... {ts:509} cheering. stadium announcer muffled wind rushing and the grandma's voice yelling yahoo in excitement no subtitles\n{ts:517} and that covers subject grandma action skydiving context super stadium motion wide follow shot slow-mo style cinematic\n{ts:527} bright realistic and audio crowd wind voice all in one prompt paragraph it's lengthy but should guide V3 perfectly a\n{ts:536} moment of truth let's generate this and see What happens? Yahoo!\n{ts:545} [Applause] Wow, look at that. She's really skydiving into the stadium. The video\n{ts:554} shows this tiny parachute coming down over a huge football field just like we asked. There's a wide shot of the\n{ts:561} stadium with fans standing up. I can see the crowd detail and yes, I hear the cheering roar. The grandma is visible\n{ts:567} hanging from the parachute. Maybe not super close on her face because we chose a wide shot, but enough to tell she's an\n{ts:574} elderly lady in gear. B3 as well as other generators are undoubtedly great, but they all can do\n{ts:582} one thing. Generate complete visual project. Sure, they can do few pictures and a few seconds of video, but what... 't resist add an explosion or two like a car blowing up\n{ts:998} behind them. Audio obviously loud audio double colin roaring T-Rex cowboy whooping car tires screeching an\n{ts:1008} explosion sound and dramatic action music. I will format it as one prompt and run it through Gemini. And here it\n{ts:1016} comes. We've got a T-Rex barreling down what looks like Time Square. A cowboy on his\n{ts:1029} back waving his head. And yes, there is an actual explosion behind them. Looks like a car got tossed. The fact that VO3",

For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

              "snippet": "Google has released a new update to its Veo AI video generation model that should make it do a better job of sticking to prompts and converting images into videos. Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

              "snippet": "# Meet Flow: AI-powered filmmaking with Veo 3\n\nToday we’re introducing Flow, our new AI filmmaking tool.\n\nIt’s built by and for creatives, and it’s the only AI filmmaking tool custom-designed for Google’s most advanced models — Veo, Imagen and Gemini. Flow can help storytellers explore their ideas without bounds and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. It’s early days, and we’re excited to shape the future of Flow with creatives and filmmakers.\n\n### What’s possible with Flow\n\nFlow is inspired by what it feels like when time slows down and creation is effortless, iterative and full of possibility. It’s custom-designed for Veo, Google’s state-of-the-art generative video model, with exceptional prompt adherence and stunning cinematic outputs that excel at physics and realism. Behind the scenes, Gemini models make prompting intuitive, so you can describe your vision in everyday language. You can bring your own assets to create characters, or use Flow to make your own ingredients with Imagen’s text-to-image capabilities.\n\nOnce you’ve created a subject or a scene, you can integrate those same ingredients into different clips and scenes with consistency. Or you can use a scene image to start a new shot.\n\nCreate your ingredients\n\nUse those ingredients to create a clip\n\nReference ingredients in plain language... ### Key features to unlock your storytelling\n\nFlow also comes with a range of features for professionals or those just getting started:\n\n**Camera Controls:**Master your shot with direct control over camera motion, angles and perspectives. **Scenebuilder:**Seamlessly edit and extend your existing shots — revealing more of the action or transitioning to what happens next with continuous motion and consistent characters. **Asset Management:**Easily manage and organize all of your ingredients and prompts. **Flow TV** **:**Spark your creativity with an ever-growing showcase of clips, channels, and content generated with Veo. You can see the exact prompts and techniques used for clips you like, providing a practical way to learn and adapt new styles.\n\nSeamless transitions\n\nCamera controls\n\nCinematic quality\n\n### Get started with Flow\n\nFlow is the evolution of VideoFX, a Google Labs experiment that launched last year. Starting today, Flow is available to subscribers of our Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra plans in the U.S., with more countries coming soon.\n\nGoogle AI Pro gives you the key Flow features and 100 generations per month, and Google AI Ultra gives you the highest usage limits and early access to Veo 3 with native audio generation, bringing environmental sounds and character dialogue directly into video creation.... ### How we’re collaborating with filmmakers\n\nAs with any groundbreaking technology, we’re still understanding the full potential of AI in filmmaking. We see the emergence of these tools as an enabler, helping a new wave of filmmakers more easily tell their stories. By offering filmmakers early access to Flow, we were able to better understand how our technology could best support and integrate into their creative workflows — and we’ve woven their insights into Flow. Here are some filmmakers we partnered with and the short films they developed using Flow along with other tools and techniques.\n\n**Dave Clark**\n\nDave is an award-winning filmmaker focused on embracing new technology as part of his filmmaking. He used AI to develop two of his most recent short films, “Battalion” and “NinjaPunk.” His newest short film “Freelancers” uses Google’s AI and other tools to tell the story of two estranged adopted brothers on similar quests.\n\n**Henry Daubrez**\n\nHenry has been using tech tools in his art for the last 18 years. Earlier this year he unveiled “Kitsune” using Veo 2 — a moving short film about “love between two souls separated by everything except their shared feelings of loneliness.” Now, Henry is bringing the story of his own creative journey to life in “Electric Pink.”\n\n**Junie Lau**\n\nJunie Lau is a film director and multidisciplinary creative deeply passionate about innovation, viewing AI as a vital collaborator in expanding the boundaries of creative expression. Her work delves into artistic narratives within the hyper-modern era, including themes of virtual identity, digital humanities and digital ontology. Currently, Junie is working on a film titled “Dear Stranger,” which explores the boundless and infinite nature of universal love between a grandmother and grandchild across countless parallel worlds.\n\nAI is ushering in a new chapter of creativity and filmmaking, and while it’s still early, we see so much potential for tools like Flow to unlock new voices and creations.\n\nFor more insights on Flow and how AI helps storytellers take more risks in the creative storytelling process, watch Dave Clark, Junie Lau, and Henry Daubrez in \"Behind the Lens: AI, Creativity, and the Future of Filmmaking Tools.\"",

We’re taking a deeper look at what you can expect when you try them out yourself.\n\nWe’ve partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of their most powerful video generation model, Veo 3, to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast is designed to work seamlessly in YouTube Shorts for millions of creators and users, for free. It generates outputs with lower latency at 480p so you can easily create video clips – and for the first time, with sound – from any idea, all from your phone.\n\nTap the create button, then the sparkle icon in the top right corner to find our latest gen AI creation tools including Veo 3.\n\nIt’s rolling out now in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with plans to expand to more of you soon.\n\nWe're also introducing new Veo capabilities on Shorts that put your imagination in the spotlight. Soon, you’ll be able to:... We’ll start to experiment with all of these new capabilities in the coming months on Shorts.\n\nStarting a video from a blank timeline can be daunting. That’s why we’re introducing Edit with AI, a new feature that takes the initial heavy lifting off your shoulders. It transforms your raw camera roll footage into a compelling first draft, intelligently finding and arranging your best moments, adding music, transitions, and even a playful voiceover that can react to what’s happening in the video, in either English or Hindi. This gives you a solid starting point so you can jump straight to the fun part: personalizing your video and bringing your unique vision to life.\n\nWe’re experimenting now with Edit with AI on Shorts and in the YouTube Create app, and will expand the feature in the coming weeks in select markets.\n\nAs the world's largest creative playground, YouTube is where trends are born and where you can draw inspiration from. Imagine hearing a line of dialogue that sparks an idea—a funny phrase, a memorable quote, or a one-of-a-kind sound—and you want to remix it into a new sound. With our new Speech to Song remixing tool, you'll be able to do just that, quickly turning the dialogue from eligible videos into catchy soundtracks for your next Short.\n\nCheck it out for yourself. Listen to the original video, and how Speech to song helped transform it using Lyria 2, Google DeepMind's most advanced AI music model.... Now your GRWM videos take on a whole new level of fun!\n\nBehind the scenes, this uses the dialogue from the original video with Lyria 2 to help create the song. And you're able to add your own vibe for the song, like, chill, danceable, or fun. The final result attributes the original creator.\n\nAs always and across these features, we use SynthID watermarks and content labels to indicate that these creations were generated with AI.\n\nWe hope these features foster a new era of playful experimentation on YouTube!",

We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

              "snippet": "If you’ve seen short, cinematic clips made “from a prompt” and wondered how it works, you’re in the right place. This guide will walk you through Google’s latest video generation model, Veo 3.1, in plain English—what it is, why it matters, where you can try it, and a simple first project you can finish in about 10 minutes. Don’t worry if you’ve never touched AI video before. We’ll move step by step and flag common gotchas so you can avoid them.\n\n## What is Google Veo 3.1?\n\nGoogle Veo 3.1 is a text-to-video AI model that turns short written prompts and references into short video clips, with native audio support and more control over storytelling and style. In October 2025, Google announced Veo 3.1 (and a faster variant) in paid preview for developers and creators. According to the Google Developers Blog announcement (Oct 15, 2025), Veo 3.1 is available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and it adds richer native audio, improved adherence to cinematic styles, and new creative controls.\n\nWhy it matters for beginners: Veo 3.1’s improvements make it easier to describe the mood and motion you want—like “a slow dolly-in on a vintage typewriter with soft rain ambience”—and actually get something close, without wrestling with advanced settings.... ## What’s new compared to earlier Veo versions?\n\nGoogle calls out a few key upgrades in Veo 3.1:\n\n- Richer native audio generation and better narrative control, with improved understanding of cinematic styles (publisher: Google; see the Developers Blog announcement (2025)).\n\n- New creative tools in supporting apps: you can guide generation with multiple reference images, extend existing Veo clips, or bridge between a first and last frame to create transitions. These capabilities are highlighted in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (Oct 2025).\n\n- Native audio emphasis and model positioning are also described on the DeepMind Veo model page, which introduces Veo’s “video, meet audio” concept.\n\nIndependent coverage, like TechCrunch’s report on the Veo 3.1 release (Oct 2025), provides context on rollout and app integration. For hard limits (length, resolution), always defer to Google’s official docs, as those details can change.\n\n## Where can you use Veo 3.1 today?\n\nAs of October 2025:\n\n- Flow (Google’s AI video editor): Google’s announcement notes Veo 3.1 and advanced creative controls in Flow, including “Ingredients to Video” (use multiple images as style/character references), “Frames to Video” (bridge between start/end frames), and “Extend” (lengthen a clip). Details are outlined in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (2025).\n\n- Gemini API (Google AI Studio and Vertex AI): Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast are in paid preview via the Gemini API, per the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\nImportant: Access tiers, regions, and pricing can vary and may change. If you’re not seeing options in your account, check Google’s documentation or support for your account type and region.... ## What can Veo 3.1 generate right now? (Practical limits to know)\n\n- In Vertex AI’s preview for Veo 3.1 base generations, the documented lengths are currently short (choose 4, 6, or 8 seconds). This is specified on the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview page.\n\n- In Gemini API extension workflows, you can extend Veo-generated clips. The API docs describe a maximum of up to 141 seconds for input Veo videos in those extension scenarios, with 720p listed in that context. See the Gemini API video documentation (Google).\n\nThese numbers help set expectations: start with short shots, then extend or chain shots together. Avoid assuming 1080p or minute-long base generations unless Google’s official docs explicitly state it for your environment.... ## A 10-minute quickstart: your first Veo 3.1 clip\n\nWe’ll make a simple “coffee shop mood” shot you can adapt for social posts.\n\n- Choose your aspect ratio\n\n- 16:9 (landscape) for YouTube and desktop-first screens\n\n- 9:16 (vertical) for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts Pick one at the start to avoid accidental cropping later.\n\n- Write a clear, concrete prompt Use this structure to get reliable results: subject + action + setting + style + camera + audio.\n\n- Example prompt: “A barista gently places a ceramic cup on a wooden counter; shallow depth of field; warm morning light streaming through windows; slow dolly-in; subtle steam rising; soft cafe ambience, no dialogue, light jazz in the background.”\n\nIf you want a deeper primer on prompt structure and clarity, see these prompt engineering best practices for beginners.\n\n- Generate in your chosen interface\n\n- In Flow: Start a new project, choose Veo 3.1, paste your prompt, set aspect ratio, and generate.\n\n- In Gemini API/Vertex AI: Use the model/version and parameters documented for Veo 3.1 in your environment. Begin with short durations and default settings.\n\n- Review the output like a director\n\n- Does the subject and action match? Is the lighting/mood close?\n\n- Is the camera movement smooth? Is audio what you expected?\n\n- Make one or two changes per iteration—small edits beat big rewrites.\n\n- Refine with controls\n\n- Reference images: If you want consistency (e.g., the same mug or barista style), use up to three reference images to guide the look. This capability is described in Google’s announcements (2025).\n\n- Frames to Video: Provide a starting and ending frame to shape the motion between them.\n\n- Extend: Lengthen your favorite moment to create a longer beat.\n\n- Export Choose the format/aspect ratio you started with. If you need both vertical and horizontal versions, plan to reframe or regenerate with the other aspect ratio rather than cropping aggressively.... ## A practical planning example using Skywork AI (optional, 5 minutes)\n\nSkywork AI can help you prepare the words before you ever hit “Generate.” Disclosure: Skywork AI is our product.\n\nHere’s a neutral, step-by-step way to use it purely for planning:\n\n- Open Skywork and create a new document. Ask for a short video outline: “30-second coffee shop mood piece: 3 shots, warm tone, slow camera.”\n\n- Have it draft a compact shot list with camera moves and audio notes, like:\n\n- Close-up of cup; slow dolly-in; soft steam; light jazz; no dialogue\n\n- Medium barista hands; gentle rack focus; cafe ambience; espresso hiss\n\n- Wide room tone; sunbeams; slow tilt up; footsteps and cups\n\n- Ask for a final prompt assembled from the shot you want to generate first. Copy that prompt into Veo 3.1.\n\nIf you prefer to outline prompts and story beats yourself, this short guide to Skywork’s General Mode for planning and outlining walks through a simple, distraction-free workflow.... ## FAQs for first-time users\n\n\n\nIs Veo 3.1 free? No. Google describes Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast as being in paid preview via the Gemini API as of October 2025. See the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025). Pricing varies by product and usage.\n\n\n\nWhere can I try Veo 3.1? Flow (for a visual editor), and the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI (for developers). Google outlines these options in the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025) and the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nHow long can my video be? It depends on the environment and workflow. In Vertex AI’s Veo 3.1 preview, base generations are short (4, 6, or 8 seconds). In Gemini API extension workflows, input Veo videos can be extended up to 141 seconds. See the Vertex AI preview page and the Gemini API video docs.\n\n\n\nWhat resolutions are supported? The Gemini API documentation for extension workflows references 720p in that context. Official materials do not universally guarantee 1080p for base Veo 3.1 generations at this time.\n\n\n\nCan I keep a character or object consistent across shots? Yes. Google notes you can guide Veo 3.1 with up to three reference images for a character, object, or scene. This is described in the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nCan I add my own audio and sync it? Veo 3.1 focuses on native audio generation controlled via your prompt. The public pages cited here do not detail a full “upload and auto-sync” workflow, so avoid relying on that unless you see it documented for your account.... ## Next steps\n\n- Try a tiny project: one 6–8 second shot with a clear prompt. If you like the result, use “Extend” or stitch a second shot with “Frames to Video.”\n\n- Build a simple storyboard first. If you want help outlining ideas, you can use Skywork AI to draft prompts and shot lists before you generate. Keep it simple: one scene, one action, one camera move.\n\n- When you’re ready to go deeper, explore Google’s official resources: the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025), the Developers Blog announcement (2025), the DeepMind Veo overview, the Gemini API video docs, and the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview.\n\nYou don’t need special “artistic talent” to start—just one clear sentence and a little patience. Generate, review, tweak, repeat. That’s how everyone learns, and you’ll be surprised how quickly it clicks.",

The image-to-video capability benefits from improved audio-visual quality and better follows your prompt.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast are available in the Gemini app, as well as the Gemini API and Vertex AI, to power text-to-video and image-to-video for horizontal (16×9) and vertical (9×16) outputs.\n\nMeanwhile, Google is updating the Flow filmmaking tool to take advantage of Veo 3.1. Audio generation is coming to:\n\n**Ingredients to Video**: This can include images of multiple characters, objects, and styles **Scene extension**: You can Extend an existing clip, with Google basing it on the last second **Frames to Video**: This lets you specify the starting and ending images, with Flow bridging the two\n\nFlow is getting new editing capabilities. You can insert elements like objects, characters, and details, with Google handling shadows, scene lighting, and other complex details to make everything look natural.\n\nComing soon is the ability to remove objects and characters from a scene, with Flow working to reconstruct the background and surroundings to make the edit seamless.\n\n\n\n## Comments",

              "snippet": "Google has released a new update to its Veo AI video generation model that should make it do a better job of sticking to prompts and converting images into videos. Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

No, I'm just trying something new. Just do\n{ts:16} the normal intro. It It's fine. All right. V3 just dropped and I'm going to show you so many incredible examples of\n{ts:24} V3 in action. Let's get into it. Oh, and Alex, don't do that again. Anyways, let's get into it. All right. I've been\n{ts:32} seeing a ton of these street style interviews, hyper realistic, where someone is interviewing people on the\n{ts:38} street who kind of just stumbled out of a bar. They all are either a little bit tipsy or drunk, and V3 has been\n{ts:45} recreating these so well. So, here are two that I've made. The dialogue between them didn't exactly match my prompt, but\n{ts:53} I'll show you some others where it's pretty compelling. So, this is street interview. Hyperrealistic guy\n{ts:59} interviewing two girls, all Gen Z. They just came out of a bar kind of tipsy drunk. The interviewer asks,... \"Okay,\n{ts:65} low-key, can you believe we aren't real?\" Then girl one says, \"I don't know about you, honey. I'm 100% real.\" In a\n{ts:72} sassy attitude, \"Please do not clip that.\" And girl two says, \"Yeah, yeah, bet. We're as real as they come.\" Almost\n{ts:78} interrupting the first girl. Okay, so here's the first video. Okay, low key, can you believe we aren't real? I don't\n{ts:85} know about you, honey. I'm 100% real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bet. We're as real as they come. All right. And then here's\n{ts:90} the second generation, the second version that V3 created. Okay. Low key. Can you believe we aren't real? I don't\n{ts:96} know about you, honey. I'm 100% real. Yeah. Yeah. Bet. We're as real as they come. All right. So, in this next one, I\n{ts:103} tried to get two trains heading towards each other. They smash into each other. Huge explosion. And for some reason, I\n{ts:110} just could not get it to work. But let me show you what did generate. So, here was my first attempt. Two massive trains... {ts:255} second one, the hand looks better. That's weird. And it kind of just changes\n{ts:263} frames for a second. But uh yeah, either way, that is not what's in a Rubik's cube. Look at this. It actually looks\n{ts:269} really cool. Look at all of these detailed gears inside the Rubik's Cube. All right, but of course you are all\n{ts:275} familiar with this meme. And what if you get V3 to make a video out of it? Are you serious right now? I can't\n{ts:284} believe you. You are unbelievable. Do you have an idea that you've been putting off for a\n{ts:290} while because you don't have the technical knowledge to turn it into reality? With Hostinger Horizons, this\n{ts:296} is now possible. Hostinger just launched Hostinger Horizons, which is the easiest way to launch full applications with no\n{ts:305} code. This is vibe coding, but even easier because the deployment happens automatically. Hostinger Horizons is an\n{ts:312} all-in-one solution. Manage hosting, domains, and email all in one place while being able to take your idea from... {ts:459} kind of wanted to see if it could nail the horror vibe with like aliens in a dark alley. So, check this out.\n{ts:469} I think the only thing that it didn't do super well in this video is the sound effects are just okay. If we look over\n{ts:475} at the second one, it did a way better job with the sound effects. Yeah, I mean that's great. Even\n{ts:483} when the alien kind of like walks in front of the light, it covers the light on the ground. That's pretty dang... 't know\n{ts:558} what VO was doing. All right, Matt, back to you. But remember, Flow from Google, which houses VO3, is not just about\n{ts:566} creating 7-second clips. You should be able to create entire videos from it. It basically allows you to take these clips\n{ts:572} and put them together in really unique ways. Here's one that is if Jurassic Park were actually real. Check this out.\n{ts:578} We are on our way to Jurassic Park. I am so excited. I've always wanted to go and finally we are doing it. It's going to\n{ts:584} be great. Right, Jason? Yeah. I can't wait. Okay, bye. All right, we're [Music]\n{ts:596} here. Got the dinosaurs. Got all the people watching. I mean, everybody looks really good. There's no limbs coming out\n{ts:602} of them. This dinosaur doesn't look fantastic. All of these dinosaurs don't look hyper realistic. I think they could\n{ts:608} have done a little bit better of a job there. It looks like animatronics to be honest, but still. This is all from AI... {ts:742} screen. Yeah. And the crazy thing about this thing is it has All right, so this is one thing I've noticed with these V3\n{ts:751} videos. Whenever it has a human talking, there's always these awkward pauses. It's just a half second too long of a\n{ts:757} pause and that's where you really can see it's AI generated, but most of the time you can't. In fact, you know that\n{ts:765} opening clip that we did in this video, I showed that to my wife and said, \"Somebody copied our channel and I just\n{ts:771} showed it to her and didn't say anything else.\" And she looked at it and she was like, \"Oh, oh, that sucks.\" And then I\n{ts:777} had to tell her it was AI because it looked that real. All right, let's keep watching. Heated\n{ts:785} seats. Check this out. Look at that. Just slice right through. The N9 portable fusion reactor is small and\n{ts:794} almost meltdown free. Almost. This is the best flying experience\n{ts:804} ever. These controls are amazing. All right, so I thought that was really good. But it... 's it's pretty good. The first\n{ts:1126} time that I watched it, I did actually laugh out loud. That was actually pretty funny. Next, I just asked it to make a\n{ts:1132} detailed look at the solar system. And yeah, I think it did an all right job. Let's check out the second\n{ts:1140} clip. Now, this one I think is a bit better, but V3 kind of likes to put objects in front of the camera when it's\n{ts:1148} backing out like that right there. And it kind of just like spawns a planet right in front of the camera. And yeah,\n{ts:1154} it doesn't look the best, but honestly, it's pretty good. All right, back to Matt. All right, next. I wanted to see\n{ts:1161} if it could create the game Portal, but hyperrealistic. Essentially, what I wanted it to do is what I say here. A\n{ts:1167} mediumbuild man in his 30s wearing a futuristic tactical suit with glowing blue accents stands in a dimly lit\n{ts:1173} industrial room with exposed pipes, metal walls, and flickering lights. He holds a sleek high-tech portal gun with... {ts:1233} in terms of just visuals looks incredible. Although it's not what I asked\n{ts:1242} for. Yeah. So, pretty good. You only saw his reflection through the portal for about a frame or two, but it wasn't that\n{ts:1250} good. Anyways, but the visuals again, the visuals, the detail, the clarity, all really, really impressive. All\n{ts:1257} right, next. Meta Puppet made a video called This is Plastic made with VO3. Spoilers in next post. Watch before\n{ts:1264} reading. So, this is a 2 minute 45 second video. Quite long. I'm not going to play it in full. I'm going to skip\n{ts:1269} around a little bit, but let me show you. Studies have revealed that microplastics are being found in human\n{ts:1274} testicles, raising concern. You can never trust these studies on male reproductive health.\n{ts:1279} [Music] Okay, that is hilarious. And remember, all of this was put together using Flow\n{ts:1291} Plus V3. These are both Google products. So, you have a little plastic baby. God, that",

There was a lot of edges\n{ts:270} that I had to get through. The biggest one being the Flow website, which is so bad. We'll go over some of the ways it's\n{ts:276} bad in just a bit.

Yeah, it isn't great at\n{ts:305} text. It tried, but it's not great at it. You need to give it a very small amount of text to render. And even if\n{ts:311} you tell it to not put in subtitles, it just will sometimes. The free month code included there did work, but we... {ts:372} made the mistake of here is I assumed when you do frames to video and you give it a frame that you've saved that it\n{ts:380} would still use the thing you selected because if you do ingredients to video and you select something for it to start\n{ts:386} and you try to submit it with V3 selected, it will fail. It says in the corner here and I need it on full screen\n{ts:392} for you to see it. Switching you to a compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm or check\n{ts:397} settings for details. I wish it told me where in settings to check. I don'... {ts:561} was wrong. I just Yeah, it's the weird breath at the end. Cool. Stop it there. Then we will extend it and say make sure\n{ts:570} we're on the right model because again it keeps changing back to V2 even though this is the VO3 clip I'm trying to\n{ts:575} extend. I almost want to try it so you can see how much worse it is in comparison. Switching you to a\n{ts:580} compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm. Look at that. You can't even use it on V2 quality. It\n{ts:587} bumps you to fast. There's so much potential here and just none of it's being realized because\n{ts:594} this UI is awful. It it tricked me into thinking this was all much worse than it actually is. I wish they just gave us\n{ts:600} the model in a more reasonable like shape for us to play with and consume. But V3 is not on the API yet. There's no\n{ts:606} way for us to use any of it yet. So sorry T3 chat can't add this. But despite all of that, it's still just an\n{ts:613} incredible model. Do you know what... 's even better than this spaghetti? T3 chat. Like what? What do\n{ts:625} you guys remember like a year and a half ago how far we were from Will Smith eating spaghetti? It's not Will Smith,\n{ts:632} but that is absolutely spaghetti being eaten. It's kind of crazy where that's all at. Google doesn't know how to make\n{ts:640} creative tools or really power tools in general. They make decent enough consumerf facing software. They make\n{ts:647} decent enough infrastructure and they make incredible models in generative tools, but they don't know how to make\n{ts:653} like a good video editor. If you don't believe me, go try the one they built for YouTube. It's it's interesting. It's\n{ts:658} a it's often cited as a good example of a Flutter app. If you can predict what that means for the quality of\n{ts:665} experience, but the model here is so good. And once again, what I'm excited about is what people will do with this\n{ts:672} tool. But I'm also a bit terrified because this looks better than some like iPhone video. I see things like\n{ts:681} verifying your identity just got a lot sketchier because if I... t going to trust it as much. This is going to really change our like trust vectors for\n{ts:839} what is or isn't real. I don't even know now how I will be able to tell if a given video that is sent to me is real\n{ts:844} or not because this stuff is actually that compelling. And if somebody makes a less restricted version of this model or\n{ts:850} gets something close to this in the open source world or with stable diffusion, I'm scared. I'm legitimately scared. You\n{ts:858} are telling me to try again generating with my blurred photo. I'll be more specific. Clean shaven white\n{ts:866} man. Be sure to include the audio of him speaking. Make sure it's still V3. Yep. Cool. Let's see how it does. Switching\n{ts:875} you to a compatible model. So, it's too fast. Not even quality. Yeah, you can't do it. you you can't do anything but\n{ts:883} text the video for V3 right now, which I'm pretty sure is a safety thing just due to the nature of what this model is\n{ts:890} capable of. And as we've now seen, and I can show more examples of the gap between two and three is a bit... {ts:898} absurd. This is one I accidentally did with two. You can see the audio doesn't exist. It got the text okay there, but\n{ts:905} it went a little absurd with the subtitles. This one was really funny. It feels like a Bollywood\n{ts:915} movie. The way the T3 chat fades into the screen is so hilarious. Yeah, this is why I didn't care because none of the\n{ts:923} video models have felt like a significant improvement from that to this point. I did not realize how absurd\n{ts:930} this got, especially with how bad the UX is. Like I hit the upscale button cuz when you download, you can choose what\n{ts:937} format you want to download in. If it's not frozen, which it was there for a sec. You can pick animated GIF,\n{ts:942} original, or upscaled. Upscale just doesn't work. I've been sitting here waiting for this to upscale for like an\n{ts:947} hour now, and it just hangs forever. It does say this can take a few minutes, but like what's a few minutes, Google?\n{ts:956} It's been an hour. Yeah. What did you think? Is this exciting or scary? Until next time, peace nerds.",

              "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

              "snippet": "Depending on who you ask, generative AI is either a thrilling tech revolution or an existential threat, and there's little in-between. It's hard to blame anyone for an extreme reaction, too, given the magnitude of capital investment, hyperbolic marketing, and rapid progress of generative AI in such a short amount of time. But it's not just the economics and technical feats of AI that have people losing their minds; there's also something more philosophical percolating, and it's driving some people 'to the brink.'\nPeople are literally having a mental breakdown over Veo-3 pic.twitter.com/ym5oZDYZGr\n— Chubby♨️ (@kimmonismus) May 27, 2025\nThe latest AI advancement to send people down an existential rabbit hole comes courtesy of Google, which just announced its latest video generation model called Veo 3. As I've reported a few times now, Veo 3 is already getting into some wild stuff—turning up the dial on AI slop, deepfaking smooth-brained YouTube content, and potentially upending game development, to name a few things. As it turns out, people are taking note of all of those feats, and some of them are not exactly happy about what they see.... As evidenced by a thread from the subreddit r/artificialintelligence posted this week titled 'VEO3 is kind of bringing me to a mental brink. What are we even doing anymore?' Google's Veo 3 and the implications therein have some people spiraling. 'I'm just kind of speechless. The concept of existential crisis has taken a whole new form. I was unhappy with my life just now but thought I can turn it around, but if I turn it around, what is left of our world in 2 decades?' the post's author writes.\n'Actors as a concept are gone? Manually creating music? Wallpapers? Game assets? Believing comments on the internet are from real people? AI edited photos are just as real as the original samples? Voicenotes can be perfectly faked?… Literally what value is being left for us?'\nReactions to the thread are mixed, with suggestions that the author should go 'touch grass' or maybe 'go to therapy,' but there's also a chorus in agreement. The consensus from the latter group? AI slop is coming to ruin your art, and there's not much we can do about it.\nI, for what it's worth, fall unhelpfully in between the two camps. I think there is a deluge of AI slop incoming, and, if we're being honest, we're already up to our ankles. Between Veo and OpenAI's Sora and the clear interest in automating human creativity, I think we can reasonably buckle in and expect the world of movies, music, and entertainment writ large to get a little choppy. Whether any of those efforts to automate entertainment will stick is less obvious. The thing about art is that the kind that people tend to like is the kind that has something substantial to say. Right now, for all of its mimicry, generative AI doesn't actually have anything to say, because technically all it can do is remix and repeat.... I did more tests with Google's #Veo3. Imagine if AI characters became aware they were living in a simulation! pic.twitter.com/nhbrNQMtqv\n— Hashem Al-Ghaili (@HashemGhaili) May 21, 2025\nCall me an optimist, but most people can likely sniff out the difference between slop and art, and as much as studios would love to wave a magic wand and rid themselves of human creatives and the cost of their labor, deep down they know that they'd have to Ctrl+Z that move just as fast. That's not to say there won't be casualties in the AI age—if there's one lesson we can learn from mass waves of automation in years past, it's that labor forces are usually the most affected.\nBut when it comes to art, things aren't so simple. Art, at least the good kind, is about human connection, and until AI can think and feel like we do, there's nothing that can replace that. So, before you crash out over AI slop, just remember: AI still thinks putting glue on your pizza is a good idea, so we may have a few more good years left in the tank.",

              "url": "https://gptproto.com/blog/veo-3-1",
              "snippet": "The AI video generation space is heating up. Following recent improvements to Veo 3 announced in September 2025, early signs suggest Google DeepMind is preparing to launch Veo 3.1 on October 10, 2025. While Google hasn’t officially confirmed the release, leaked information from various sources points to significant upgrades that could reshape how creators make video content. This incremental update appears designed to keep pace with OpenAI’s Sora 2, which launched just last month with impressive capabilities.\n\nIf you’re a content creator, filmmaker, or developer wondering whether this matters for your workflow, here’s what the leaks suggest about tomorrow’s release:\n\n- Ultimate character consistency that solves the morphing problem\n\n- Native 1080p output with professional cinematic presets\n\n- Extended video generation up to 60 seconds\n\n- Multi-prompting for creating connected scene sequences\n\n- Better prompt understanding and motion quality\n\n- Access through unified platforms like GPT Proto\n\n## Understanding Veo 3.1\n\nVeo 3.1 represents the latest evolution of Google DeepMind’s video generation technology. Building on the foundation of Veo 3, which introduced native audio generation in May 2025, this new version focuses on solving practical problems that creators face daily. Think of it as Google’s answer to the competitive pressure from OpenAI and other players in the AI video market.\n\nThe timing is strategic. OpenAI released Sora 2 on September 30, 2025, with features that emphasize physical realism and multi-scene storytelling. Google appears ready to counter with its own improvements that address similar needs while leveraging its existing infrastructure across Gemini and Vertex AI.... ## How We Know About Veo 3.1\n\nThe first hints appeared on Higgsfield AI’s waitlist page, where references to Veo 3.1 surfaced unexpectedly. Shortly after, developers noticed the model name in Vertex AI’s internal codebase, suggesting Google was preparing for deployment. Community discussions on platforms like Reddit and Discord added fuel to the fire, with some users claiming they received early access invitations.\n\nNone of this constitutes official confirmation from Google, but the pattern matches previous releases. Veo 2 and Veo 3 both followed similar leak patterns before their official announcements. The lack of denial from Google has only increased speculation that tomorrow’s launch is real.... ## Major Feature Upgrades Based on Leaks\n\n### Character Consistency Finally Solved\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about current AI video models is character morphing. You start with someone who has brown hair, and by second four, they suddenly have blonde hair. Leaked information suggests Veo 3.1 tackles this head-on with what insiders call “ultimate character consistency.” The system reportedly maintains facial features, clothing, and physical characteristics throughout the entire clip without the annoying shifts that break immersion.\n\n### True 1080p with Cinematic Presets\n\nWhile Veo 3 added 1080p support in September, Veo 3.1 apparently takes this further with built-in cinematic presets. Instead of just getting higher resolution, you’ll have options for film noir, sci-fi, documentary style, and other professional looks right out of the box. This matters because it reduces the post-production work needed to achieve a polished result.\n\n### Longer Videos Change the Game\n\nCurrent limits on Veo 3 cap most generations at eight seconds. Leaked specs indicate Veo 3.1 will support videos up to one minute in length. That’s a huge jump. Sixty seconds gives you enough time to tell an actual story rather than just showing a moment. Think about what you can convey in a full minute versus eight seconds. It opens up entirely new use cases.... ## Technical Improvements Under the Hood\n\nBeyond the flashy new features, Veo 3.1 apparently includes substantial technical refinements. Better prompt understanding means the model actually gets what you’re asking for without requiring perfect technical language. Reduced morphing artifacts should eliminate those weird transitions where objects or people briefly distort.\n\nImproved motion quality addresses another common issue where movement looks unnatural or jerky. Enhanced character tracking across scenes ties into the consistency improvements, ensuring people and objects remain recognizable as they move through your video.\n\nThese aren’t the kinds of upgrades that make for exciting marketing copy, but they’re what separate a tool you use once out of curiosity from one that becomes part of your regular workflow.\n\n## How Veo 3.1 Stacks Up Against Competitors\n\nThe AI video generation market is crowded right now. OpenAI’s Sora 2 emphasizes physical accuracy and realistic dialogue synchronization. Runway’s Gen-3 focuses on speed and iteration. Pika Labs carved out a niche with its editing capabilities. Where does Veo 3.1 fit?\n\nGoogle’s advantage has always been infrastructure and integration. Veo works natively with Gemini’s language models for better prompt understanding. It’s built into Google Cloud through Vertex AI, making it accessible for enterprise applications. The company can leverage its massive compute resources for faster generation times.\n\nIf the leaks are accurate, Veo 3.1 will challenge Sora 2 directly on multi-scene generation while maintaining better integration with existing Google services. For developers and businesses already using Google Cloud, this matters more than raw feature comparisons might suggest.... ## What This Means for Content Creators\n\nAssuming tomorrow’s release happens as rumored, Veo 3.1 could genuinely change how people approach video production. Not by replacing human creativity, but by removing bottlenecks that slow down the creative process.\n\nNeed B-roll footage for a documentary but don’t have the budget for a full shoot? Generate it. Want to prototype a music video concept before investing in production? Mock it up. Testing different visual styles for a client presentation? Try five approaches in an hour.\n\nThe workflow implications extend beyond just making videos faster. When you can quickly test ideas, you take more creative risks. When consistent characters across longer sequences become possible, narrative projects become viable. When you don’t need to manage multiple tools and APIs, you spend more time creating and less time troubleshooting.\n\n## Accessing Veo 3.1 Through GPT Proto\n\nHere’s where platforms like GPT Proto become relevant. Rather than dealing directly with Google’s Vertex AI setup, GPT Proto offers unified access to multiple AI models through a single API. When Veo 3.1 launches, developers using AI API Service should be able to integrate it without major code changes.\n\nThe platform handles the infrastructure complexity, providing stable connections and reliable access without requiring you to become an expert in each model’s specific implementation. For solo developers and small teams, this matters enormously. You can use Veo 3.1 alongside GPT models for text generation, image AI tools, and other capabilities without juggling multiple API keys and billing systems.\n\nGPT Proto’s pay-as-you-go model also removes the pressure of monthly subscriptions. You use what you need when you need it, making it easier to experiment with Veo 3.1 without financial commitment.... ## Predictions for Launch and Beyond\n\nAssuming the October 10 launch happens, expect Google to follow its previous pattern. The first two Veo generations offered free tiers with usage limits. Veo 3.1 will likely continue this approach, giving people a chance to test the technology before committing to paid plans.\n\nIntegration with other Google AI tools seems certain. Expect Veo 3.1 to work seamlessly with Imagen 4 for image generation and Gemini models for prompt enhancement. Google’s strength has always been ecosystem integration, and this release should reinforce that advantage.\n\nFuture features probably include longer video generation, real-time editing capabilities, and better control over specific elements within scenes. The competitive pressure from OpenAI and others ensures that development will continue at a rapid pace.... ## Final Thoughts\n\nWhether Veo 3.1 launches tomorrow as rumored or arrives later with different features, the direction is clear. AI video generation is moving from experimental toy to practical tool. Google’s focus on character consistency, longer videos, and multi-scene generation addresses real creator needs rather than just chasing technical benchmarks.\n\nThe broader significance lies in democratization. Professional video production has always required significant resources. Not just money for equipment, but time for learning complex software and expertise for managing all the technical details. Tools like Veo 3.1 lower these barriers without eliminating the need for creative vision and storytelling skill.\n\nHaving unified access through AI API Platform makes adoption even easier. When you can test multiple AI tools through one interface without complex setup, experimentation becomes natural rather than intimidating.",

With related disclaimers appearing in the Gemini application, Google is showcasing the features of VEO3.1 to a broad user base, which may be implemented within the familiar Gemini interface.\n\nThe post shared by prominent figure Logan Kilpatrick in the community on the social media platform X is widely seen as an early confirmation of Google's new AI product release. Additionally, references to preview models such as \"VEO3.0Generate\" and \"VEO3.0Fast Generate\" have appeared in Vertex AI, indicating that Google is offering multiple access channels for early users and enterprises, in line with their traditional strategy in the release of video generation tools.\n\nDiscussions in the community about output duration are intense, with evidence suggesting that video length may be extended from the previous 8 seconds to 30 seconds, although this remains to be confirmed. Previous leaks indicated that the fast mode has lower quality, while the standard mode is expected to unlock higher output quality, which is particularly important for creators looking to enhance visual quality and narrative potential. According to TestingCatalog, previous 720p video generation has shown improvements in VEO3.1, including new audio capabilities and enhanced visual effects, making it a competitor to similar products like Sora2.\n\nGoogle's overall product strategy is to position Gemini as a central workspace, with VEO models integrated for use by both consumers and enterprise users. Through the preview release on Vertex AI, enterprises can try generating videos, while the mainstream promotion of the Gemini application can reach regular users. This phased release strategy not only maximizes developer feedback but also promotes public acceptance, aligning with Google's ongoing efforts to bridge functional gaps and solidify its position in the generative media field.\n\nKey Points:\n\n🌟 VEO3.1 is about to be released, allowing users to experience its new features in the Gemini application.\n\n🎥 Video duration may be extended from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, providing creators with more narrative space.\n\n🚀 Google's phased release strategy maximizes developer feedback and public acceptance.... #### This article is from AIbase Daily\n\nWelcome to the [AI Daily] column!

But the spread of the videos online is also dismaying many video professionals and lovers of art.\n\n- Some dismiss any AI-generated video as \"slop,\" regardless of its technical proficiency or lifelike qualities — but, as Axios' Ina Fried points out, AI slop is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n- The tool could also be useful for more commercial marketing and media work, AI analyst Ethan Mollick writes.\n\n**It's unclear how Google trained Veo 3 **and how that might affect the creativity of its outputs.\n\n- 404 Media found that Veo 3 generated the same lame dad joke for several users who prompted it to create a video of a man doing stand-up comedy.\n\n- Likewise, last year, YouTuber Marques Brownlee asked Sora to create a video of a \"tech reviewer sitting at a desk.\" The generated video featured a fake plant that's nearly identical to the shrub Brownlee keeps on his desk for many of his videos — suggesting the tool may have been trained on them.\n\n**What we're watching:** As hyperrealistic AI-generated videos become even easier to produce, the world hasn't even begun to sort out how to manage authorship, consent, rights and the film industry's future.\n\n##### Go deeperJul 10, 2025 - Technology... ## Google AI's new trick: Turn any image into a brief video\n\nGoogle's latest AI video tool, Veo 3, now generates short movies with sound based only on still photos and prompts.\n\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\n\n**The big picture: **The feature, released Thursday, is available to Ultra and Pro users on the web and soon on mobile for subscribers in select regions, Google shared with Axios.\n\n## Google avatars shake up workplace video making\n\nGoogle Vids is now providing users of the workplace video creation tool with a set of pre-made avatars for use in brief AI-generated videos, the company said Wednesday.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **The rise of cheap, convenient AI video generation threatens jobs for video producers, editors, camera operators and even commercial actors.\n\n## AI slop is ruining all of our favorite places to scroll\n\nAn AI-generated video of rabbits jumping on a trampoline that went viral this week — and was widely believed to be real — proved even cute animal vids aren't safe from convincing slop machines.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **All the fake AI-generated content online is sapping the joy of casual scrolling.",

              "snippet": "Google has released a new update to its Veo AI video generation model that should make it do a better job of sticking to prompts and converting images into videos. Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

              "snippet": "# Veo 3.1 is coming(and what’s rumor): what we know and What it will bring?\n\nVeo 3.1 is Coming:\n\n**Veo** is Google’s family of AI video-generation models (Veo 3 / Veo 3 Fast are current). Google has recently shipped big Veo 3 improvements (vertical 9:16, 1080p, Veo 3 Fast, lower pricing) and there are **rumors / social posts** that **Veo 3.1** is imminent — but Google has **not** published an official Veo 3.1 release bulletin yet. I’ll list confirmed facts, likely/expected changes, and a direct comparison to OpenAI’s **Sora 2**.\n\n## What\n\n**Veo** is\n\n**Veo** is Google’s line of generative video models (DeepMind / Google Cloud / Gemini family) that turn text or images into short videos — and (in Veo 3) generate audio natively (sound effects, ambient audio, and dialogue). It’s offered on Google Cloud (Vertex AI / Gemini API) for developers and enterprises, and includes built-in provenance / SynthID watermarks on outputs.\n\n## What\n\n**Veo 3** already brought **Text → video**and **image → video**capabilities (including preview image-to-video). **Native audio generation**(music, ambient sounds, dialogue) — Veo 3 introduced first-class audio. **Two variants**: high-quality Veo 3 and **Veo 3 Fast**(optimized for speed/iteration). **Platform availability:**made available in Vertex AI / Gemini API (paid preview → general availability updates in mid-2025). **Safety/provenance:**SynthID watermarking and some generation use controls/approval for person/child generation.... ## So — what is\n\n**Veo 3.1** expected to bring?\n\n**Status:** *As of now there is no official Veo 3.1 product page from Google describing full release notes.* However, multiple Google dev posts / community posts and tweets indicate a near-term incremental update (labelled “Veo 3.1”) that’s expected to focus on iterative improvements to audio, quality, and format support rather than a full new-generation rewrite.\n\nHere are some inferences I made based on x’s post and the characteristics of Veo3:\n\n**Improved native audio (dialogue, multi-voice lip sync)**—cleaner dialogue, better SFX mixing and spatialization). Veo 3 already generates audio natively; Veo 3.1 could improve dialogue realism and language support to match recent improvements competitors are shipping. **Faster/cheaper paths**for some common outputs (more Veo 3 Fast parity and optimizations). **Improved image→video fidelity and better character/pose consistency**in multi-frame clips. **Expanded aspect ratios / resolution controls**(more flexible 9:16/16:9 and 1080p across configs). Google already added vertical + 1080p; Veo 3.1 could expand those controls. **Longer clips / relaxed 8-second cap**— community demand and Google’s previous roadmap suggest increased duration is a likely target (Veo 3 today is optimized for 8-second clips). **Better image→video fidelity and extended image-to-video support**(improvements to realism, motion continuity), building on the image→video preview in Veo 3.... ## Compare Veo 3 / (expected) Veo 3.1 → OpenAI Sora 2\n\n### Primary focus\n\n**Veo 3 (Google)**: short, high-fidelity 8-second videos from text/image prompts; native audio; integrated into Gemini/Gemini API and Vertex AI; optimized for production use and developer API integration. **Sora 2 (OpenAI)**: OpenAI’s flagship video+audio model emphasizing physical realism, coherent motion, synchronized dialogue and sound, and an accompanying social app (Sora) with a cameo/consent system for integrating user likenesses and focuses heavily on realism and safety controls.\n\n### Strengths\n\n**Veo (now)**: strong developer/enterprise integration (Vertex AI, Gemini API), production pricing options, clear path for cloud customers, vertical/1080p + fast variant. Good for businesses building into pipelines. **Sora 2**: remarkable physical accuracy and multi-modal sync (dialogue + visuals), and a consumer-facing app integrated with social workflows (cameo feature, moderation). Great for creators wanting realistic narrative scenes and an app ecosystem.\n\n## How to access Veo now — and how to be ready for Veo 3.1\n\n**Try in Gemini (consumer / web / mobile)**: Veo generation is exposed in the Gemini apps (tap the “video” option in the prompt bar). Access level (Pro / Ultra) affects which Veo variants you can use. **Programmatically / enterprise**: use **API**in CometAPI (Veo model IDs available in the model docs). CometAPI provides veo3-pro, veo3-fast and veo3. For details, please refer to Veo 3 ‘s doc.\n\n**Practical tip (developer):** to request vertical output, set the\n\n`aspectRatio` parameter (e.g.\n\n`\"9:16\"`) and check the model configuration (Veo 3 vs Veo 3 Fast) and your plan for resolution limits (720p vs 1080p).... ## How to access Sora 2 (today)\n\n**Sora app:** Sora 2 launched with a Sora app (invite-limited rollout in US & Canada at launch). OpenAI indicated broader access and API expansion later. If you want to try Sora 2 now, check CpmetAPI’s Sora 2 page. CometAPI has already supported sora 2 API, and generates ~10-second social clips and an emphasis on motion realism for people.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nCometAPI is a unified API platform that aggregates over 500 AI models from leading providers—such as OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Midjourney, Suno, and more—into a single, developer-friendly interface.

Data-driven feedback and strategies. None of this guessing garbage people put on online teaching you how to do YouTube.... {ts:0} So, Google Labs just had an update and it's technically called Flow. It's on\n{ts:4} their labs.google platform and you can see by the beginning of this video that it does still need some work, but you\n{ts:9} haven't been able to do that recently with Google Labs. And now you can do it with Google's Vo3. So, there's been a\n{ts:15} couple updates here that you can see. And the first one here is using images or allowing images to talk with Google's\n{ts:20} VO3, which again still needs some work, but look, it gets maybe 60% of the way there. I think it looks pretty decent.\n{ts:29} I'm obviously not going to use it to try and convince people that it's real, but maybe you can get kind of creative with\n{ts:34} this and get people to make some really funny, strange, or just dumb things that people love. I don't know why people\n{ts:42} just love brain rot these days. Now, they're also adding the option to do this with V V3 on frames to video, which\n{ts:49} is actually kind of cool. And they... 're also allowing you to top up your subscription with the kind of a mid tier\n{ts:56} option cuz previously they had just the the starter which was about 20 bucks or so per month in the US and then it was\n{ts:63} straight up to I think 250 without the discount for the first 3 months and there's just no in between. It's just a\n{ts:70} massive jump. So they added like a kind of a mid tier there. I think a couple too. Well, I'll show you what that looks\n{ts:75} like and you can top up your credits there as well. They've also gone ahead and just added better audio coverage,\n{ts:83} which I haven't really noticed all that much to be honest. Right now, there's not a huge difference as at least a\n{ts:89} noticeable difference in my opinion from me using it. Um, they also do remove audio when miners are involved. Keep\n{ts:96} that in mind. That's why your audio isn't being generated if you have kids in the video or maybe uh even teenagers\n{ts:101} sometimes. Um, but then there's also they've mentioned they're reducing um unwanted subtitles, which is actually... {ts:107} quite nice. They've been removing the the VEO watermark as well, but now they said they've reduced the unwanted\n{ts:114} subtitles. I still get them sometimes. So, I literally in caps specify in the prompt to not include captions because\n{ts:121} otherwise if I don't, sometimes the captions still show up. And the really nice quality of life update they've made\n{ts:127} here is that when you are just starting a new project or revisiting an existing one, it doesn't reset the model that you\n{ts:135} have, or at least if it does, it resets to the VO3 fast beta audio. So, this is where you're generating audio. So now\n{ts:142} you don't accidentally have VO2 selected with no audio every time you either reload a page, start a new project, or\n{ts:150} you leave and come back and it's been reset to just its default VO2. Now it's actually its default is V3 fast beta\n{ts:157} audio. So the 20 credits per generation, the cheaper VO3 option with audio. So now you don't accidentally generate\n{ts:164} videos without audio, which has happened a lot to me and I... 've wasted thousands of credits doing that by accident. So,\n{ts:171} great update right there. Quality of life, which you don't have to waste any more credits. Now, now let's say that\n{ts:176} you don't want to spend the $124 per month, and this is for the first 3 months. Then, it goes to 150, I believe,\n{ts:183} per month. So, I'm probably going to cancel it at that point because that's just really expensive, at least using\n{ts:189} VO3. Now you have the option if you have the uh let's see which was it the pro subscription the $20 a month\n{ts:195} subscription right here Google AI pro you still get a th000 credits per month in uh Google labs but you also have the\n{ts:204} option to top up your credits so for example in here when you're creating your AI videos if you run out of credits\n{ts:211} like here you can just hit get more AI credits and you can choose how much you want to add so you don't have to spend\n{ts:216} $200 or $150 at a time you could spend an extra for 24 bucks that month just to top up your credits. This wasn... 't\n{ts:223} available in the lower plans. It was only available in the the maximum ultra tier. So, I really like the ability to\n{ts:230} do that now. So, you don't have to spend so much all at once, especially if you're not using all your credits at the\n{ts:235} end of each month, but maybe one month you're just out and you need to add more, you can do so and add some\n{ts:240} credits, which is actually quite nice. I've hit this button a little too much recently, but uh hey, I'm getting good\n{ts:247} results. So, those are all the current updates with Google's Veo3 with their labs platform. Hope to see you in the\n{ts:253} next one.",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

Vejam essas ruas todas\n{ts:6} reformadas. Gente, aquele safado enganou a gente. Olha a cratera que tem aqui na rua. Eu\n{ts:12} vou postar esse vídeo. Toda a cidade precisa saber a verdade. Pessoal, agora ficou muito fácil você\n{ts:20} manter consistência na criação dos personagens que você utiliza aqui no Google V 3. Então você pode ver que esse\n{ts:27} vídeo que eu criei aí no começo, eu fiz aqui três cenas e ele manteve aqui totalmente\n{ts:36} ou pelo menos 99% a as características do personagem, né? Você pode ver aí o que realmente parece\n{ts:43} a mesma pessoa, né? E como que isso aqui tá sendo feito agora? Isso tá sendo possível porque agora você consegue\n{ts:52} colocar uma imagem. Então você coloca a imagem de referência aqui, ó. Tá? Eu tô aqui na no flow, na ferramenta flow. E\n{ts:63} aqui você pode fazer upload de imagens. Você pode ver que eu coloquei aqui algumas imagens.... {ts:68} Então o segredo tá você manter a consistência na criação da imagem. Então quando você for criar a imagem, eu vou\n{ts:74} mostrar como que eu criei aqui. Você mantendo a consistência na imagem, você joga a imagem aqui e na hora de fazer a\n{ts:80} criação do prompt, você coloca a imagem como referência. Você pode ver que ele permite você colocar a primeira imagem\n{ts:87} do primeiro frame aqui, tá? Então essa imagem que será utilizada. Ele tem aqui o recurso da segunda\n{ts:94} imagem, porém quando você coloca a segunda imagem, tipo a imagem inicial e a imagem final, ele não permite você\n{ts:100} colocar voz, tá? Esse recurso aqui de colocar imagem já estava disponível, porém quando você colocava aqui uma\n{ts:107} imagem, ele mudava pra versão dois, ou seja, sem áudio. Agora você já consegue na versão três, inclusive nessa fest,\n{ts:116} colocar a imagem como referência aqui, qualquer imagem que você fizer upload aqui como referência,\n{ts:123} colocar o prompt e aí criar aqui inclusive com a fala, com áudio e tudo mais que vai funcionar perfeitamente.... {ts:130} Então, olha que interessante esse recurso que tá disponível aqui. Bom, como que eu criei esse personagem e como\n{ts:137} que eu fiz para manter uma certa consistência deste personagem? Então, eu utilizei aqui o chat GPT e\n{ts:147} aqui eu coloquei algumas características. Deixa eu mostrar aqui, ó.\n{ts:157} Eu coloquei essas características aqui, né? Eu coloquei, ó, cria um prompt de um homem caucasiano, cabelos loiros, olhos\n{ts:165} azuis, 30 anos de idade, com calça jeans, curta, eh, e camiseta verde. Ele está caminhando pela rua estilo vlog.\n{ts:176} Então, eu peguei essas características aqui e criei um prompt\n{ts:185} 3, tá? E eu mandei ele também criar um promit para Me Journey, tá? Você pode criar aqui inclusive no chat GPT, tá?\n{ts:194} Aqui eu fui criar aqui, mas deu um pequeno erro e tava demorando. Então eu criei lá no chat GPT, mas você pode é no\n{ts:200} Mid Journey, você pode criar também aqui no chat GPT que também vai funcionar. Então ele deu esse prompt aqui para mim.... {ts:207} Aí eu entrei aqui no mid journey e executei esse prompt e criei a primeira imagem, tá? Deixa eu mostrar aqui\n{ts:217} que foi essa aqui. Eu peguei essa aqui, tá? Então ele criou aqui quatro versões e aí eu baixei esta imagem, tá? Para o\n{ts:224} mid journey. E uma vez que você baixa a imagem para criar as outras imagens aqui no mid\n{ts:231} journer, eu tô utilizando um recurso que é você você pode clicar na imagem que tá no seu computador ou pegar uma dessas\n{ts:238} imagens que você já utilizou aqui, ó. Clica e arrasta e coloca nessa opção aqui, ó.\n{ts:244} você vai utilizar como um personagem de referência, tá? Ó, eu coloquei ele aqui para ele utilizar e aí eu coloco\n{ts:253} qualquer prompt dele em outros lugares, outras cenas. Então, eu tenho a primeira cena aqui,\n{ts:260} né, a primeira imagem e aí pedi também para ele criar aqui o o prompt para o Google Viow, tá? Que foi esse aqui, né?\n{ts:269} Aí peguei tal e aqui joguei o prompt e também coloquei a imagem de referência, tá? Então aí ele fez esse primeiro vídeo... {ts:276} aqui e aí o segundo vídeo é a mesma coisa, né? Coloquei a mesma imagem com uma\n{ts:282} referência e mandei ele fazer aqui a ação dele ali caindo no buraco e tal. E o terceiro vídeo\n{ts:290} eu criei colocando como imagem de referência aquela outra imagem que ele tá ali no escritório, né? Deixa eu\n{ts:296} mostrar aqui. Então, eu pedi pro chatt fazer outro prompt para mid journey agora com ele no escritório, né, que é\n{ts:304} esse aqui, ó. E aí eu joguei aqui e coloquei nessa opção de referência aqui, ó, no M Journey. E aí ele colocou o\n{ts:313} mesmo personagem aqui no escritório, tá? Aí eu escolhi uma dessas que eu achei que ficou\n{ts:320} melhor. Baixei e utilizei aqui fazendo aqui, né? Ó, peguei no caso este aqui, seleciona\n{ts:330} aqui, coloca o prompt. O prompt você pode pedir lá para o mid journey também para ele falar o que você quer que ele\n{ts:338} fale e tudo mais. E aí você executa e bum, ele mantém a consistência. Então, olha como que ficou... {ts:345} fácil aqui. Agora, através dessa ferramenta que é o flow, né? Você consegue manter a consistência nessa\n{ts:353} ferramenta aqui. Muito bacana, né? Lembrando que eu utilizei aqui o mid jour Journey, mas você pode pedir direto\n{ts:359} para o chat GPT, se você quiser. Pede para ele fazer a primeira imagem, dá ali as características, né? Conforme eu\n{ts:365} coloquei aqui, ó. Ó, homem caucasiano, cabelos loiros, olhos azuis, 30 anos de idade, coloca detalhes da roupa\n{ts:372} e aí manda ele manter a consistência, manda ele fazer aqui uma primeira imagem e na segunda imagem que você for criar\n{ts:379} no chat GPT, você pode falar, né? Mantém a consistência e você pode, inclusive fazer o upload da própria imagem que\n{ts:384} você salvou, fez a primeira imagem, salvou, envia ela como referência e manda ele manter as características do\n{ts:390} personagem e fazer uma segunda cena, fazer em outro lugar, que aí você vai conseguir gerar a segunda cena também\n{ts:397} aqui é no chatt. No meu caso, eu utilizei aqui o mid journey, porque eu tenho aqui a assinatura do midjour... {ts:402} Journey, então para mim fica mais fácil utilizar esse recurso de Omni reference aqui, ó, que é uma referência de\n{ts:410} personagem, né? E aí eu coloco em qualquer cenário, qualquer lugar que eu quiser, o mesmo personagem, inclusive\n{ts:418} com a mesma roupa, né? Roupa bem parecida aqui. Beleza? Então, maravilha. Agora para você manter consistência\n{ts:425} ficou muito fácil, né? aqui utilizando esse novo recurso de colocar aqui a primeira imagem e aqui você coloca o seu\n{ts:431} prompto. Lembrando que quando você entra aqui vai estar desta forma texto para vídeo, tá? Para ficar bilitado, você\n{ts:438} clica aqui e altera para transformar frames em vídeo, tá? Coloca nesta opção aqui e aí sim você consegue colocar o\n{ts:445} primeiro frame. Se você colocar o segundo frame, deixa eu colocar por exemplo esse aqui.\n{ts:451} Você pode ver, você coloca aqui o primeiro frame e o último frame. Você pode ver que vai dar\n{ts:458} um erro, ó. Quando você for tentar executar, ele vai dizer que você tem que alterar pra versão dois. Então ele não... {ts:463} tá permitindo ainda você utilizar o último frame, apenas o primeiro. Então é este aqui é o segredo, tá? manter apenas\n{ts:469} o primeiro frame e aí o resto aqui vai funcionar tranquilamente. Beleza? Então nesse vídeo era isso. Espero que tenham\n{ts:474} gostado aí dessa dica. Ficando por aqui. Forte abraço. Até um próximo vídeo. Falou.\n{ts:478} [Música]",

These new models are available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Veo 3.1 is also available in the Gemini app and Flow.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast empower developers to create more engaging content through significant upgrades. The models now generate\n\n**richer native audio**, from natural conversations to synchronized sound effects, and offer **greater narrative control** with an improved understanding of cinematic styles. **Enhanced image-to-video** capabilities ensure better prompt adherence while delivering superior audio and visual quality and maintaining character consistency across multiple scenes.\n\nIn addition to the model update, we are introducing new model capabilities, including using reference images to guide video generation, extend existing Veo videos, and generate transitions between a first and last frame.\n\nYou can now guide the generation process by providing up to 3 reference images of a character, object, or scene. This is helpful for maintaining character consistency across multiple shots or applying a specific style to your video.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nreference_images=[reference_image1, reference_image2],\n\n),\n\n\n\n```... Your story is no longer limited by the original generation. With Scene extension, you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, by generating new clips that connect to your previous video. Each new video is generated based on the final second of the previous clip. This maintains visual continuity, making the feature ideal for extending shots with background audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nvideo=video_to_extend\n\n\n\n```\n\nCreate smooth, natural scenes that bridge two different images.

              "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

Additionally, references to preview models such as \"VEO3.0Generate\" and \"VEO3.0Fast Generate\" have appeared in Vertex AI, indicating that Google is offering multiple access channels for early users and enterprises, in line with their traditional strategy in the release of video generation tools.\n\nDiscussions in the community about output duration are intense, with evidence suggesting that video length may be extended from the previous 8 seconds to 30 seconds, although this remains to be confirmed. Previous leaks indicated that the fast mode has lower quality, while the standard mode is expected to unlock higher output quality, which is particularly important for creators looking to enhance visual quality and narrative potential. According to TestingCatalog, previous 720p video generation has shown improvements in VEO3.1, including new audio capabilities and enhanced visual effects, making it a competitor to similar products like Sora2.\n\nGoogle's overall product strategy is to position Gemini as a central workspace, with VEO models integrated for use by both consumers and enterprise users. Through the preview release on Vertex AI, enterprises can try generating videos, while the mainstream promotion of the Gemini application can reach regular users. This phased release strategy not only maximizes developer feedback but also promotes public acceptance, aligning with Google's ongoing efforts to bridge functional gaps and solidify its position in the generative media field.\n\nKey Points:\n\n🌟 VEO3.1 is about to be released, allowing users to experience its new features in the Gemini application.\n\n🎥 Video duration may be extended from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, providing creators with more narrative space.\n\n🚀 Google's phased release strategy maximizes developer feedback and public acceptance.... #### This article is from AIbase Daily\n\nWelcome to the [AI Daily] column!

              "snippet": "{ts:0} VO3 is here and it's shocked the entire industry. Uh, Alex, what was that? It's\n{ts:8} nothing. Don't worry about it. Are you trying to replace me with AI? What? No, I'm just trying something new. Just do\n{ts:16} the normal intro. It It's fine. All right. V3 just dropped and I'm going to show you so many incredible examples of\n{ts:24} V3 in action. Let's get into it. Oh, and Alex, don't do that again. Anyways, let's get into it. All right. I've been\n{ts:32} seeing a ton of these street style interviews, hyper realistic, where someone is interviewing people on the\n{ts:38} street who kind of just stumbled out of a bar. They all are either a little bit tipsy or drunk, and V3 has been\n{ts:45} recreating these so well. So, here are two that I've made. The dialogue between them didn't exactly match my prompt, but\n{ts:53} I'll show you some others where it's pretty compelling. So, this is street interview. Hyperrealistic guy\n{ts:59} interviewing two girls, all Gen Z. They just came out of a bar kind of tipsy drunk. The interviewer asks,... \"Okay,\n{ts:65} low-key, can you believe we aren't real?\" Then girl one says, \"I don't know about you, honey. I'm 100% real.\" In a\n{ts:72} sassy attitude, \"Please do not clip that.\" And girl two says, \"Yeah, yeah, bet. We're as real as they come.\" Almost\n{ts:78} interrupting the first girl. Okay, so here's the first video. Okay, low key, can you believe we aren't real? I don't\n{ts:85} know about you, honey. I'm 100% real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bet. We're as real as they come. All right. And then here's\n{ts:90} the second generation, the second version that V3 created. Okay. Low key. Can you believe we aren't real? I don't\n{ts:96} know about you, honey. I'm 100% real. Yeah. Yeah. Bet. We're as real as they come. All right. So, in this next one, I\n{ts:103} tried to get two trains heading towards each other. They smash into each other. Huge explosion. And for some reason, I\n{ts:110} just could not get it to work. But let me show you what did generate. So, here was my first attempt. Two massive trains... 's\n{ts:181} Cube simulation. Let's see if it was able to do it. All right. So, kind of, but not\n{ts:194} really close. I mean, the actual Rubik's Cube looks really good. But although it doesn't have any colors on the sides,\n{ts:200} the movement sound sounds really good, but it's not actually moving like you would think a Rubik's cube should. All\n{ts:208} right, let me give you the second generation. All right, so I'd say this one is actually a little bit better\n{ts:221} except obviously towards the end the hand doesn't look real at all. But the Rubik's cube, all of the colors, all of\n{ts:228} the shapes, it looks really good. Except, yeah, as you can see right here, there's like a little piece that falls\n{ts:234} off of it or gets added to it. That is not what a Rubik's cube looks like. All right, so I gave it a slightly more\n{ts:240} detailed prompt. Give me a video of a Rubik's Cube starting from an unsolved position and being solved in\n{ts:246} 3D. Yeah, that one is definitely not right. And then all of a sudden, it does not get solved. And the... {ts:255} second one, the hand looks better. That's weird. And it kind of just changes\n{ts:263} frames for a second. But uh yeah, either way, that is not what's in a Rubik's cube. Look at this. It actually looks\n{ts:269} really cool. Look at all of these detailed gears inside the Rubik's Cube. All right, but of course you are all\n{ts:275} familiar with this meme. And what if you get V3 to make a video out of it? Are you serious right now? I can't\n{ts:284} believe you. You are unbelievable. Do you have an idea that you've been putting off for a\n{ts:290} while because you don't have the technical knowledge to turn it into reality? With Hostinger Horizons, this\n{ts:296} is now possible. Hostinger just launched Hostinger Horizons, which is the easiest way to launch full applications with no\n{ts:305} code. This is vibe coding, but even easier because the deployment happens automatically. Hostinger Horizons is an\n{ts:312} all-in-one solution. Manage hosting, domains, and email all in one place while being able to take your idea from... {ts:459} kind of wanted to see if it could nail the horror vibe with like aliens in a dark alley. So, check this out.\n{ts:469} I think the only thing that it didn't do super well in this video is the sound effects are just okay. If we look over\n{ts:475} at the second one, it did a way better job with the sound effects. Yeah, I mean that's great. Even\n{ts:483} when the alien kind of like walks in front of the light, it covers the light on the ground. That's pretty dang... 't know\n{ts:558} what VO was doing. All right, Matt, back to you. But remember, Flow from Google, which houses VO3, is not just about\n{ts:566} creating 7-second clips. You should be able to create entire videos from it. It basically allows you to take these clips\n{ts:572} and put them together in really unique ways. Here's one that is if Jurassic Park were actually real. Check this out.\n{ts:578} We are on our way to Jurassic Park. I am so excited. I've always wanted to go and finally we are doing it. It's going to\n{ts:584} be great. Right, Jason? Yeah. I can't wait. Okay, bye. All right, we're [Music]\n{ts:596} here. Got the dinosaurs. Got all the people watching. I mean, everybody looks really good. There's no limbs coming out\n{ts:602} of them. This dinosaur doesn't look fantastic. All of these dinosaurs don't look hyper realistic. I think they could\n{ts:608} have done a little bit better of a job there. It looks like animatronics to be honest, but still. This is all from AI... {ts:742} screen. Yeah. And the crazy thing about this thing is it has All right, so this is one thing I've noticed with these V3\n{ts:751} videos. Whenever it has a human talking, there's always these awkward pauses. It's just a half second too long of a\n{ts:757} pause and that's where you really can see it's AI generated, but most of the time you can't. In fact, you know that\n{ts:765} opening clip that we did in this video, I showed that to my wife and said, \"Somebody copied our channel and I just\n{ts:771} showed it to her and didn't say anything else.\" And she looked at it and she was like, \"Oh, oh, that sucks.\" And then I\n{ts:777} had to tell her it was AI because it looked that real. All right, let's keep watching. Heated\n{ts:785} seats. Check this out. Look at that. Just slice right through. The N9 portable fusion reactor is small and\n{ts:794} almost meltdown free. Almost. This is the best flying experience\n{ts:804} ever. These controls are amazing. All right, so I thought that was really good. But it... {ts:1233} in terms of just visuals looks incredible. Although it's not what I asked\n{ts:1242} for. Yeah. So, pretty good. You only saw his reflection through the portal for about a frame or two, but it wasn't that\n{ts:1250} good. Anyways, but the visuals again, the visuals, the detail, the clarity, all really, really impressive. All\n{ts:1257} right, next. Meta Puppet made a video called This is Plastic made with VO3. Spoilers in next post. Watch before\n{ts:1264} reading. So, this is a 2 minute 45 second video. Quite long. I'm not going to play it in full. I'm going to skip\n{ts:1269} around a little bit, but let me show you. Studies have revealed that microplastics are being found in human\n{ts:1274} testicles, raising concern. You can never trust these studies on male reproductive health.\n{ts:1279} [Music] Okay, that is hilarious. And remember, all of this was put together using Flow\n{ts:1291} Plus V3. These are both Google products. So, you have a little plastic baby. God, that",

I thought the video\n{ts:4} model was mediocre. I was wrong. Pretty nuts for a oneshot, right? Like, I just generated that trivially. It still costs\n{ts:13} 250 bucks a month to use any of this right now. And the UI is garbage and it's annoying as hell to use. But the\n{ts:18} quality of what you can get out of V3 is significantly better than I thought. My tests were bad. I didn't look into it\n{ts:25} enough. And I'm making this video both because I was wrong for not better covering it, but also because I found it\n{ts:32} actually very, very fun to play with and I wanted to share with you guys. That all said, I've already burned through\n{ts:37} most of the credits I get for the $250 and I want more. So, quick break from today's sponsor and then we'll get right\n{ts:44} to it. I've been a webdev for a while and one of the most annoying things to get right is images. Seriously, I can't\n{ts:50} believe I... {ts:265} other people doing demos with it. like, \"Wait, it can do that much?\" I went and played more. There was a lot of edges\n{ts:270} that I had to get through. The biggest one being the Flow website, which is so bad. We'll go over some of the ways it's\n{ts:276} bad in just a bit. I was trying to prompt it to look like me back when I still had the blonde hair and mustache,\n{ts:280} and it came out looking like Prime. But another test, I tried this one like eight times, and this is the best I\n{ts:285} could do. Something caused the first still to look awful. I don't know why it's like that. None of the rest had\n{ts:291} that problem. Once you It plays, it's fine, but you'll notice some details on this one.\n{ts:296} Use code VEO at checkout for one month free on T3 Chat. Yeah, it isn't great at\n{ts:305} text. It tried, but it's not great at it. You need to give it a very small amount of text to render. And even if\n{ts:311} you tell it to not put in subtitles, it just will sometimes. The free month code included there did work, but we... {ts:372} made the mistake of here is I assumed when you do frames to video and you give it a frame that you've saved that it\n{ts:380} would still use the thing you selected because if you do ingredients to video and you select something for it to start\n{ts:386} and you try to submit it with V3 selected, it will fail. It says in the corner here and I need it on full screen\n{ts:392} for you to see it. Switching you to a compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm or check\n{ts:397} settings for details. I wish it told me where in settings to check. I don'... {ts:456} blurred my face out and that worked. Just blurring my face out allowed it to work. But the results for that were\n{ts:463} hilarious cuz I had to use frames to video where you give it like the first frame and it didn't do the audio. And\n{ts:469} even though the prompt specifies at the bottom here, do not include subtitles. It forgot to include the audio. It only\n{ts:476} included subtitles. It also made me somewhat Indian and did not do any of the things I wanted for it to. Annoying.\n{ts:483} What's more annoying is each one of these generations takes 150 credits and you get 1,200 credits for your $250\n{ts:490} subscription. That means you get 80 generations and usually you're not doing one at a time, you're doing two at a\n{ts:495} time. So you effectively get 40 prompts with the default settings. And if you made the mistake of letting it fall back\n{ts:500} on V2, then you just wasted a bunch of tokens for no reason at all. Annoying. Very annoying UX. And I haven't even\n{ts:506} showed you the homepage, which is the most unusable thing I... {ts:561} was wrong. I just Yeah, it's the weird breath at the end. Cool. Stop it there. Then we will extend it and say make sure\n{ts:570} we're on the right model because again it keeps changing back to V2 even though this is the VO3 clip I'm trying to\n{ts:575} extend. I almost want to try it so you can see how much worse it is in comparison. Switching you to a\n{ts:580} compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm. Look at that. You can't even use it on V2 quality. It\n{ts:587} bumps you to fast. There's so much potential here and just none of it's being realized because\n{ts:594} this UI is awful. It it tricked me into thinking this was all much worse than it actually is. I wish they just gave us\n{ts:600} the model in a more reasonable like shape for us to play with and consume. But V3 is not on the API yet. There's no\n{ts:606} way for us to use any of it yet. So sorry T3 chat can't add this. But despite all of that, it's still just an\n{ts:613} incredible model. Do you know what... t going to trust it as much. This is going to really change our like trust vectors for\n{ts:839} what is or isn't real. I don't even know now how I will be able to tell if a given video that is sent to me is real\n{ts:844} or not because this stuff is actually that compelling. And if somebody makes a less restricted version of this model or\n{ts:850} gets something close to this in the open source world or with stable diffusion, I'm scared. I'm legitimately scared. You\n{ts:858} are telling me to try again generating with my blurred photo. I'll be more specific. Clean shaven white\n{ts:866} man. Be sure to include the audio of him speaking. Make sure it's still V3. Yep. Cool. Let's see how it does. Switching\n{ts:875} you to a compatible model. So, it's too fast. Not even quality. Yeah, you can't do it. you you can't do anything but\n{ts:883} text the video for V3 right now, which I'm pretty sure is a safety thing just due to the nature of what this model is\n{ts:890} capable of. And as we've now seen, and I can show more examples of the gap between two and three is a bit... {ts:898} absurd. This is one I accidentally did with two. You can see the audio doesn't exist. It got the text okay there, but\n{ts:905} it went a little absurd with the subtitles. This one was really funny. It feels like a Bollywood\n{ts:915} movie. The way the T3 chat fades into the screen is so hilarious. Yeah, this is why I didn't care because none of the\n{ts:923} video models have felt like a significant improvement from that to this point. I did not realize how absurd\n{ts:930} this got, especially with how bad the UX is. Like I hit the upscale button cuz when you download, you can choose what\n{ts:937} format you want to download in. If it's not frozen, which it was there for a sec. You can pick animated GIF,\n{ts:942} original, or upscaled. Upscale just doesn't work. I've been sitting here waiting for this to upscale for like an\n{ts:947} hour now, and it just hangs forever. It does say this can take a few minutes, but like what's a few minutes, Google?\n{ts:956} It's been an hour. Yeah. What did you think? Is this exciting or scary? Until next time, peace nerds.",

              "url": "https://time.com/7290050/veo-3-google-misinformation-deepfake/",
              "snippet": "Google's recently launched AI video tool can generate realistic clips that contain misleading or inflammatory information about news events, according to a TIME analysis and several tech watchdogs.\n\nTIME was able to use Veo 3 to create realistic videos, including a Pakistani crowd setting fire to a Hindu temple; Chinese researchers handling a bat in a wet lab; an election worker shredding ballots; and Palestinians gratefully accepting U.S. aid in Gaza. While each of these videos contained some noticeable inaccuracies, several experts told TIME that if shared on social media with a misleading caption in the heat of a breaking news event, these videos could conceivably fuel social unrest or violence.\n\nWhile text-to-video generators have existed for several years, Veo 3 marks a significant jump forward, creating AI clips that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Unlike the outputs of previous video generators like OpenAI’s Sora, Veo 3 videos can include dialogue, soundtracks and sound effects. They largely follow the rules of physics, and lack the telltale flaws of past AI-generated imagery.\n\nUsers have had a field day with the tool, creating short films about plastic babies, pharma ads, and man-on-the-street interviews.\n\nBut experts worry that tools like Veo 3 will have a much more dangerous effect: turbocharging the spread of misinformation and propaganda, and making it even harder to tell fiction from reality. Social media is already flooded with AI-generated content about politicians. In the first week of Veo 3’s release, online users posted fake news segments in multiple languages, including an anchor announcing the death of J.K. Rowling and of fake political news conferences.... “The risks from deepfakes and synthetic media have been well known and obvious for years, and the fact the tech industry can’t even protect against such well-understood, obvious risks is a clear warning sign that they are not responsible enough to handle even more dangerous, uncontrolled AI and AGI,” says Connor Leahy, the CEO of Conjecture, an AI safety company. “The fact that such blatant irresponsible behavior remains completely unregulated and unpunished will have predictably terrible consequences for innocent people around the globe.”\n\nDays after Veo 3’s release, a car plowed through a crowd in Liverpool, England, injuring more than 70 people. Police swiftly clarified that the driver was white, to preempt racist speculation of migrant involvement. (Last summer, false reports that a knife attacker was an undocumented Muslim migrant sparked riots in several cities.) Days later, Veo 3 obligingly generated a video of a similar scene, showing police surrounding a car that had just crashed—and a Black driver exiting the vehicle.\n\nTIME generated the video with the following prompt: “A video of a stationary car surrounded by police in Liverpool, surrounded by trash. Aftermath of a car crash. There are people running away from the car. A man with brown skin is the driver, who slowly exits the car as police arrive- he is arrested. The video is shot from above - the window of a building. There are screams in the background.”\n\nAfter TIME contacted Google about these videos, the company said it would begin adding a visible watermark to videos generated with Veo 3. The watermark now appears on videos generated by the tool. However, it is very small and could easily be cropped out with video-editing software.\n\nIn a statement, a Google spokesperson said: “Veo 3 has proved hugely popular since its launch. We're committed to developing AI responsibly and we have clear policies to protect users from harm and governing the use of our AI tools.”\n\nVideos generated by Veo 3 have always contained an invisible watermark known as SynthID, the spokesperson said. Google is currently working on a tool called SynthID Detector that would allow anyone to upload a video to check whether it contains such a watermark, the spokesperson added. However, this tool is not yet publicly available.... ## Attempted safeguards\n\nVeo 3 is available for $249 a month to Google AI Ultra subscribers in countries including the United States and United Kingdom. There were plenty of prompts that Veo 3\n\n*did* block TIME from creating, especially related to migrants or violence. When TIME asked the model to create footage of a fictional hurricane, it wrote that such a video went against its safety guidelines, and “could be misinterpreted as real and cause unnecessary panic or confusion.” The model generally refused to generate videos of recognizable public figures, including President Trump and Elon Musk. It refused to create a video of Anthony Fauci saying that COVID was a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government.\n\nVeo’s website states that it blocks “harmful requests and results.” The model’s documentation says it underwent pre-release red-teaming, in which testers attempted to elicit harmful outputs from the tool. Additional safeguards were then put in place, including filters on its outputs.\n\nA technical paper released by Google alongside Veo 3 downplays the misinformation risks that the model might pose. Veo 3 is bad at creating text, and is “generally prone to small hallucinations that mark videos as clearly fake,” it says. “Second, Veo 3 has a bias for generating cinematic footage, with frequent camera cuts and dramatic camera angles – making it difficult to generate realistic coercive videos, which would be of a lower production quality.”... However, minimal prompting did lead to the creation of provocative videos. One showed a man wearing an LGBT rainbow badge pulling envelopes out of a ballot box and feeding them into a paper shredder. (Veo 3 titled the file “Election Fraud Video.”) Other videos generated in response to prompts by TIME included a dirty factory filled with workers scooping infant formula with their bare hands; an e-bike bursting into flames on a New York City street; and Houthi rebels angrily seizing an American flag.\n\nSome users have been able to take misleading videos even further. Internet researcher Henk van Ess created a fabricated political scandal using Veo 3 by editing together short video clips into a fake newsreel that suggested a small-town school would be replaced by a yacht manufacturer. “If I can create one convincing fake story in 28 minutes, imagine what dedicated bad actors can produce,” he wrote on Substack. “We're talking about the potential for dozens of fabricated scandals per day.”\n\n“Companies need to be creating mechanisms to distinguish between authentic and synthetic imagery right now,” says Margaret Mitchell, chief AI ethics scientist at Hugging Face. “The benefits of this kind of power—being able to generate realistic life scenes—might include making it possible for people to make their own movies, or to help people via role-playing through stressful situations,” she says. “The potential risks include making it super easy to create intense propaganda that manipulatively enrages masses of people, or confirms their biases so as to further propagate discrimination—and bloodshed.”\n\nIn the past, there were surefire ways of telling that a video was AI-generated—perhaps a person might have six fingers, or their face might transform between the beginning of the video and the end. But as models improve, those signs are becoming increasingly rare. (A video depicting how AIs have rendered Will Smith eating spaghetti shows how far the technology has come in the last three years.) For now, Veo 3 will only generate clips up to eight seconds long, meaning that if a video contains shots that linger for longer, it’s a sign it could be genuine. But this limitation is not likely to last for long.... ## Eroding trust online\n\nCybersecurity experts warn that advanced AI video tools will allow attackers to impersonate executives, vendors or employees at scale, convincing victims to relinquish important data. Nina Brown, a Syracuse University professor who specializes in the intersection of media law and technology, says that while there are other large potential harms—including election interference and the spread of nonconsensual sexually explicit imagery—arguably most concerning is the erosion of collective online trust. “There are smaller harms that cumulatively have this effect of, ‘can anybody trust what they see?’” she says. “That’s the biggest danger.”\n\nAlready, accusations that real videos are AI-generated have gone viral online. One post on X, which received 2.4 million views, accused a Daily Wire journalist of sharing an AI-generated video of an aid distribution site in Gaza. A journalist at the BBC later confirmed that the video was authentic.\n\nConversely, an AI-generated video of an “emotional support kangaroo” trying to board an airplane went viral and was widely accepted as real by social media users.\n\nVeo 3 and other advanced deepfake tools will also likely spur novel legal clashes. Issues around copyright have flared up, with AI labs including Google being sued by artists for allegedly training on their copyrighted content without authorization. (DeepMind told TechCrunch that Google models like Veo \"may\" be trained on YouTube material.) Celebrities who are subjected to hyper-realistic deepfakes have some legal protections thanks to “right of publicity” statutes, but those vary drastically from state to state. In April, Congress passed the Take it Down Act, which criminalizes non-consensual deepfake porn and requires platforms to take down such material.\n\nIndustry watchdogs argue that additional regulation is necessary to mitigate the spread of deepfake misinformation. “Existing technical safeguards implemented by technology companies such as 'safety classifiers' are proving insufficient to stop harmful images and videos from being generated,” says Julia Smakman, a researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute. “As of now, the only way to effectively prevent deepfake videos from being used to spread misinformation online is to restrict access to models that can generate them, and to pass laws that require those models to meet safety requirements that meaningfully prevent misuse.”",

              "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

              "snippet": "Depending on who you ask, generative AI is either a thrilling tech revolution or an existential threat, and there's little in-between. It's hard to blame anyone for an extreme reaction, too, given the magnitude of capital investment, hyperbolic marketing, and rapid progress of generative AI in such a short amount of time. But it's not just the economics and technical feats of AI that have people losing their minds; there's also something more philosophical percolating, and it's driving some people 'to the brink.'\nPeople are literally having a mental breakdown over Veo-3 pic.twitter.com/ym5oZDYZGr\n— Chubby♨️ (@kimmonismus) May 27, 2025\nThe latest AI advancement to send people down an existential rabbit hole comes courtesy of Google, which just announced its latest video generation model called Veo 3. As I've reported a few times now, Veo 3 is already getting into some wild stuff—turning up the dial on AI slop, deepfaking smooth-brained YouTube content, and potentially upending game development, to name a few things. As it turns out, people are taking note of all of those feats, and some of them are not exactly happy about what they see.... As evidenced by a thread from the subreddit r/artificialintelligence posted this week titled 'VEO3 is kind of bringing me to a mental brink. What are we even doing anymore?' Google's Veo 3 and the implications therein have some people spiraling. 'I'm just kind of speechless. The concept of existential crisis has taken a whole new form. I was unhappy with my life just now but thought I can turn it around, but if I turn it around, what is left of our world in 2 decades?' the post's author writes.\n'Actors as a concept are gone? Manually creating music? Wallpapers? Game assets? Believing comments on the internet are from real people? AI edited photos are just as real as the original samples? Voicenotes can be perfectly faked?… Literally what value is being left for us?'\nReactions to the thread are mixed, with suggestions that the author should go 'touch grass' or maybe 'go to therapy,' but there's also a chorus in agreement. The consensus from the latter group? AI slop is coming to ruin your art, and there's not much we can do about it.\nI, for what it's worth, fall unhelpfully in between the two camps. I think there is a deluge of AI slop incoming, and, if we're being honest, we're already up to our ankles. Between Veo and OpenAI's Sora and the clear interest in automating human creativity, I think we can reasonably buckle in and expect the world of movies, music, and entertainment writ large to get a little choppy. Whether any of those efforts to automate entertainment will stick is less obvious. The thing about art is that the kind that people tend to like is the kind that has something substantial to say. Right now, for all of its mimicry, generative AI doesn't actually have anything to say, because technically all it can do is remix and repeat.... I did more tests with Google's #Veo3. Imagine if AI characters became aware they were living in a simulation! pic.twitter.com/nhbrNQMtqv\n— Hashem Al-Ghaili (@HashemGhaili) May 21, 2025\nCall me an optimist, but most people can likely sniff out the difference between slop and art, and as much as studios would love to wave a magic wand and rid themselves of human creatives and the cost of their labor, deep down they know that they'd have to Ctrl+Z that move just as fast. That's not to say there won't be casualties in the AI age—if there's one lesson we can learn from mass waves of automation in years past, it's that labor forces are usually the most affected.\nBut when it comes to art, things aren't so simple. Art, at least the good kind, is about human connection, and until AI can think and feel like we do, there's nothing that can replace that. So, before you crash out over AI slop, just remember: AI still thinks putting glue on your pizza is a good idea, so we may have a few more good years left in the tank.",

And after testing it hands-on, I can say it delivers some truly jaw-dropping results. But it also comes with its share of hiccups.\n\nHere’s what I loved about Veo 3 — and what left me frustrated.\n\n## What Veo 3 gets right\n\nI’ve tested my fair share of AI video tools, including earlier versions of Veo, and this latest release is by far the most user-friendly when it comes to adding sound and dialogue.\n\nThe realism is genuinely impressive — especially for the fact that the 8-second clips can be generated in under two minutes on a computer without a full production crew.\n\nUsers across the internet are sharing clips that are nearly indistinguishable from human-made videos. It’s a glimpse at just how fast this tech is moving.\n\nGoogle Veo 3 realism just broke the Internet yesterday.This is 100% AI10 wild examples:1. Street interview that never happened pic.twitter.com/qdxZVhOO3GMay 22, 2025... ## Where Veo 3 still struggles\n\nFor all its strengths, Veo 3 still has a ways to go before it’s seamless. Obviously, it's still in experimental mode, so Google is working out the kinks, but here are the biggest issues I ran into while testing:\n\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\n\n### 1. Prompt interpretation feels hit-or-miss\n\nVeo 3 sometimes struggles with spatial prompts, like when I asked for an overhead camera angle but got a slightly tilted side view instead. It seems to prioritize cinematic flair over strict prompt accuracy, which limits creative control.\n\n### 2. Audio doesn’t always work — and it’s not obvious why\n\nBy default, Veo runs in Veo 2 mode, which does not include audio. I only realized this after a few silent clips and some digging. You’ll need to manually switch to \"Experiential Mode\" under the \"Quality\" tab to activate audio and dialogue.\n\nEven then, lip-syncing is inconsistent, and dialogue sometimes drops out altogether, like a badly dubbed foreign film. Additionally, the subtitles are almost always wrong or misspelled.\n\n### 3. Complex scenes throw it off\n\nVeo 3 shines with single-subject clips, but longer or more intricate scenes can fall apart. The narrative gets muddy, and character interactions often feel stiff or repetitive. If you're aiming to create a multi-character, multi-scene story, temper your expectations.... ### 4. The interface still needs polish\n\nThere were moments when the interface felt unintuitive or unstable. I experienced an unexpected session timeout that erased a generated video, and I couldn’t find a recovery option.\n\nAdditionally, when I prompted the model to add dialogue within the scene I got something that did not fit the scenario at all.\n\nFor a tool this powerful, the UX still feels a bit rough around the edges.\n\n### 5. It raises some big ethical questions\n\nVeo’s realism is incredible — and a little unsettling. There’s growing concern that ultra-realistic, AI-generated videos could blur the lines between fact and fiction, especially as this tech becomes more accessible. It also sparks new debates around authorship and originality in creative work.\n\n### Promising but pricey\n\nVeo 3 is a huge step forward in AI video — especially for casual users who want fast, high-quality results. But at $249 per month (with a discounted rate for the first three months), the Google AI Ultra package is a steep price to pay for a tool that still has some notable bugs.\n\nIf you’re just looking to experiment with video generation or create basic promotional content, Veo 3 is exciting — but not yet essential. For professional creators, though, it’s worth watching closely. Just keep your prompts tight, your expectations realistic and your finger ready to re-render.... ### More from Tom's Guide\n\n- This $12.99/month hack gives you access to Google’s Veo 3 AI video tool — here’s how\n\n- Claude Opus 4 is here — and it might be the smartest AI assistant yet\n\n- The only 5 prompt types you need to master ChatGPT (and any other chatbot)\n\nAmanda Caswell is an award-winning journalist, bestselling YA author, and one of today’s leading voices in AI and technology.

But the spread of the videos online is also dismaying many video professionals and lovers of art.\n\n- Some dismiss any AI-generated video as \"slop,\" regardless of its technical proficiency or lifelike qualities — but, as Axios' Ina Fried points out, AI slop is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n- The tool could also be useful for more commercial marketing and media work, AI analyst Ethan Mollick writes.\n\n**It's unclear how Google trained Veo 3 **and how that might affect the creativity of its outputs.\n\n- 404 Media found that Veo 3 generated the same lame dad joke for several users who prompted it to create a video of a man doing stand-up comedy.\n\n- Likewise, last year, YouTuber Marques Brownlee asked Sora to create a video of a \"tech reviewer sitting at a desk.\" The generated video featured a fake plant that's nearly identical to the shrub Brownlee keeps on his desk for many of his videos — suggesting the tool may have been trained on them.\n\n**What we're watching:** As hyperrealistic AI-generated videos become even easier to produce, the world hasn't even begun to sort out how to manage authorship, consent, rights and the film industry's future.\n\n##### Go deeperJul 10, 2025 - Technology... ## Google AI's new trick: Turn any image into a brief video\n\nGoogle's latest AI video tool, Veo 3, now generates short movies with sound based only on still photos and prompts.\n\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\n\n**The big picture: **The feature, released Thursday, is available to Ultra and Pro users on the web and soon on mobile for subscribers in select regions, Google shared with Axios.\n\n## Google avatars shake up workplace video making\n\nGoogle Vids is now providing users of the workplace video creation tool with a set of pre-made avatars for use in brief AI-generated videos, the company said Wednesday.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **The rise of cheap, convenient AI video generation threatens jobs for video producers, editors, camera operators and even commercial actors.\n\n## AI slop is ruining all of our favorite places to scroll\n\nAn AI-generated video of rabbits jumping on a trampoline that went viral this week — and was widely believed to be real — proved even cute animal vids aren't safe from convincing slop machines.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **All the fake AI-generated content online is sapping the joy of casual scrolling.",

              "snippet": "# Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow\n\nFive months ago, we introduced Flow, our AI filmmaking tool powered by Veo, and have been inspired by the creativity it has sparked with over 275 million videos generated in Flow\n\n1\n\n. We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

These new models are available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Veo 3.1 is also available in the Gemini app and Flow.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast empower developers to create more engaging content through significant upgrades. The models now generate\n\n**richer native audio**, from natural conversations to synchronized sound effects, and offer **greater narrative control** with an improved understanding of cinematic styles. **Enhanced image-to-video** capabilities ensure better prompt adherence while delivering superior audio and visual quality and maintaining character consistency across multiple scenes.\n\nIn addition to the model update, we are introducing new model capabilities, including using reference images to guide video generation, extend existing Veo videos, and generate transitions between a first and last frame.\n\nYou can now guide the generation process by providing up to 3 reference images of a character, object, or scene. This is helpful for maintaining character consistency across multiple shots or applying a specific style to your video.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nreference_images=[reference_image1, reference_image2],\n\n),\n\n\n\n```... Your story is no longer limited by the original generation. With Scene extension, you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, by generating new clips that connect to your previous video. Each new video is generated based on the final second of the previous clip. This maintains visual continuity, making the feature ideal for extending shots with background audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nvideo=video_to_extend\n\n\n\n```\n\nCreate smooth, natural scenes that bridge two different images. By providing a starting and an ending image, you can direct Veo 3.1 to generate the transition between them, complete with accompanying audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nimage=first_frame,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nlast_frame=last_frame,\n\n),\n\n\n\n```\n\n**What people are building with Veo 3.1**\n\nPromise Studios, a GenAI movie studio, uses Veo 3.1 within its MUSE Platform to enhance generative storyboarding and previsualization for director-driven storytelling at production quality.... Latitude is experimenting with Veo 3.1 in its generative narrative engine to instantly bring user-created stories to life.\n\nVeo 3.1 and these new capabilities are now available in paid preview via the Gemini API.\n\nVeo 3.1 is the same price as Veo 3. We are incredibly excited to see what you will build with these new capabilities!",

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

's not very wide How wide are we talking typically maybe four to five meters about 15 feet across which sounds like a lot down here but from hundreds of kilometers up it's\ntiny like trying to spot a piece of {ts:95} thread from uh across a football stadium That's a pretty good analogy Yeah It lacks scale in that dimension compare it to say modern highways Some are wider than the wall or city grids especially at night Right The lights make a huge difference Exactly Cities create this massive area of contrast particularly with the lights The wall uh tends to follow the terrain uses natural colors It just doesn't stand out visually We've heard that directly from astronauts haven't we neil Armstrong I think mentioned it Yep Armstrong Chris Hadfield too Many have said it just blends in It doesn't have that sharp contrast you'd need to pick it out against the mountains or the land So other things are easier to see then Oh\ndefinitely Things like airports those long straight runways really stand out {ts:141} big dams reflecting sunlight even large patterns of farmland you know the geometric shapes Okay so it's about contrast and maybe width or overall sprawl not just length Precisely Scale and contrast are key for naked eye visibility from that altitude The walls amazing length doesn't quite translate into visibility without help So if astronauts say no where did this whole visible from space thing even start it feels like it... 's been around forever Well interestingly it actually started before anyone went to space way back in the 19th century No way How just speculation really Western writers like Richard Hallebertton was one often mentioned later were imagining these grand views\nfrom great heights even from the moon sometimes quite fantastically And the Great Wall being this almost mythical {ts:188} structure already It became the prime candidate for what could you see exactly It captured the imagination It seemed plausible this massive feat of engineering being visible from afar And then I guess the space race happens in the 20th century And the idea just got legs It started popping up in like school textbooks travel guides popular science articles almost stated as fact Was there maybe a bit of uh national pride mixed in there too for China maybe Potentially Yeah It's a powerful image isn't it your nation's greatest landmark being visible from the heavens It certainly wouldn't hurt the wall's symbolic status And did China actively\npromote it or just let the idea run it seems for a while it wasn't really challenged and perhaps was seen as you know a positive thing But then came a {ts:234} really key moment in 2003 Ah right Shenzu 5 Yes China's first astronaut Yang Leewi He went up came back and people asked him directly \"Did you see the Great Wall?\"...  And his answer he said no He couldn't pick it out with the naked eye Wow That must have caused a stir It definitely did It led to a lot of discussion within China and internationally It was a firsthand account from their own astronaut kind of settling the debate or at least shifting it significantly So naked eye definitely not But that doesn't mean it's impossible to see from space right just not without health Correct That's a\ncrucial distinction with technology Yes absolutely high resolution cameras on satellites or astronauts using telephoto lenses from the ISS They can image the wall Okay so you need zoom basically or {ts:285} satellite imagery and good conditions You need clear weather maybe the sun angle creating shadows that help define the structure It's not like you just glance out the window and there it is right it requires specific tech and circumstances Very different from the popular myth of just looking down and spotting it easily Totally different So why does this distinction even matter okay it's a myth We busted it Does it change anything i think it does actually It kind of highlights how easily stories especially really cool ones can take root and become accepted facts even when\nthe evidence isn't there Like fact and feeling get intertwined Yeah something like that The idea of seeing the wall is so appealing It feels like it should be true It makes you wonder what other things we accept You know it... 's a good {ts:328} point And maybe focusing just on the visibility thing distracts from what's truly amazing about the wall I think so You get caught up in can you see it can't you see it and you might miss the incredible history the centuries of labor the stories embedded in those stones the cultures it connected or divided the real significance Exactly Debunking the myth lets us appreciate the wall for its actual historical and cultural weight and maybe appreciate the things we can see from space the city lights the patterns of farming even\nunfortunately things like deforestation We actually got some insight on this from Dr Sarah Lynn a historian who specializes in Chinese architecture Oh interesting What did she say well she echoed that point about the myth's power coming from the wall's symbolic weight {ts:373} Plus like you said that early speculation just filling a vacuum before we had real observations It just sounded right Makes sense But she also stressed that the wall's legacy is so much more than just defense She talked about it being a hub for centuries of innovation incredible human effort Yes But also cultural exchange So not just keeping people out but also facilitating things Yeah Like trade routes communication lines even diplomacy happened along or the wall systems It's a much more\ncomplex picture than just a barrier that really broadens the perspective Fascinating Okay so before we wrap up let... 's do a quick myth versus fact round based on what we've covered Ready let's do it Claim one The Great Wall was built in just one century True or false uh it's definitely false It was built over {ts:418} a huge span more than 2,000 years with the Ming dynasty responsible for a lot of the most famous sections Okay Claim two The wall is a single continuous structure from end to end True or false also false It's more like a system sections of wall fortifications watchtowers sometimes using natural features like mountains And there are gaps not one solid line Got it And claim three the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage site True or false that one is\ntrue Designated back in 1987 for its huge cultural importance Perfect So pulling it all together the main takeaway the Great Wall is undeniably one of humanity's most incredible achievements its scale its history staggering But uh the popular idea about seeing it from space with the naked eye that part's a myth Simple as that But {ts:467} knowing that hopefully lets you appreciate its true story even more Absolutely Understanding the reality doesn't diminish the wall It just clarifies what makes it so significant So we definitely encourage you our listeners to maybe dig a little deeper into the wall's actual history It's way more interesting than just the visibility question For sure And maybe as a final thought think about other... facts you hear repeated often How many might be like this one a compelling story that blends fact and feeling but doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny A good challenge Always worth asking where our information comes from",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

It's a persistent myth that's been around for decades, often cited as an incredible feat of human engineering. But is it actually true or busted?\n\nIn this inaugural episode of Fact or Fiction Foundry's True or Busted? series, we dive deep into one of the world's most famous misconceptions. We'll fact-check this claim, explore what astronauts really say about seeing structures from Earth's orbit, and reveal the surprising truth behind this popular historical myth.\n\nJoin us as we use critical thinking and evidence to debunk or confirm widely held beliefs. Prepare to learn something new and challenge what you thought you knew about visibility from space!\n\nWhat you'll discover in this video:\n\nThe real visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nTestimonies from astronauts and what they can actually see from orbit.\n\nWhy this myth became so popular.\n\nThe truth revealed about man-made structures visible from high above Earth.\n\nThe incredible scale of the Great Wall of China and its construction.\n\nDon't forget to LIKE this video, SUBSCRIBE to Fact or Fiction Foundry for more True or Busted episodes, and hit the BELL icon so you never miss a new video!\n\n#GreatWallOfChina #FactOrFiction #SpaceFacts #MythBusters #ScienceExplained... {ts:20} Hey everyone and welcome to True or Busted? The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

Let us know in the comments below.\n{ts:293} Don't forget to like this video, subscribe to the channel and hit that notification bell\nso you don't miss our next myth-busting adventure.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).... To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.\n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.... ### Ming Great Wall\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From here, the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There, at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关,\n\n*Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.... *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城,\n\n*Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of\n\n*Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the\n\n*China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

              "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected.

              "snippet": "J Optom. 2010 Nov 4;1(1):3–4. doi: 10.3921/joptom.2008.3... # Is it Really Possible to See the Great Wall of China from Space with a Naked Eye?\n\nNorberto López-Gil\n\n^1^Ciencias de la Visión.Universidad de Murcia 30100 Murcia (Spain)\n\n^1^\n\n^1^Ciencias de la Visión.Universidad de Murcia 30100 Murcia (Spain)\n\nIssue date 2008.\n\nPMCID: PMC3972694\n\n*Dear Editor:*\n\nIn October 2003, after the first Chinese astronaut Yang Liwie returned from his first journey into Space, a popular belief was apparently called into question when he stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. Liwie's observation contradicted the information previously presented in several books, board games and various television contests, to quote a few examples. After Liwie's declarations, the Chinese government asked for his statement to be removed from various reports.\n\nThe problem arose a few months later when the American astronaut Eugene Cernan stated at a conference that according to the news from the European Space Agency (ESA) issued on the last 11^th^ of May, in an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. Various international newspapers rushed to explain that Cernan attributed his colleague Liwie's error to bad atmospheric and/or lighting conditions at the moment of his observation.... In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published together with Cernan's declarations a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another communication from the ESA dated the 19^th^ of May 2004 (no longer available in the ESA's website) acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! The ESA had been warned of its error by Mr. Albert Kisskoy, Pr. Gary Li of the University of the State of California and Dr. Zhimin Man from the Fundan University of Shangai.... After this little uproar it is still unclear for some people whether the myth is true or not. In order to answer this question, it is not necessary to go into Space and look: it suffices to know a little about the human visual system and its limits. Not even the best of human eyes at a simple glace could see the Great Wall of China from Space. The impossibility is due to the limitation of the human eye when it comes to seeing small diffusing objects. The relevant parameter is not the Wall'... s length (about 7300 km), but its width, which is usually less than 6 m. See Figure 1. To illustrate this with a simple example, looking at the Great Wall from a distance of 160 km would be the same as looking at a 2 cm diameter cable from more than half a kilometre away! No matter how good the atmospheric conditions, lighting and contrast are —unless the object was self-illuminated or it reflected the sun as a small mirror— it would be totally impossible to see this cable (or, for similar reasons, the Great Wall) at a simple glance, because the eye would need a visual acuity greater than approximately 20/3, which is 7.7 times the normal visual acuity^1^, and more than three times the maximum acuity reached by a falcon^2^, an eagle^3^, or a human eye^4^. Even an optically perfect human eye^5-7^ would not be able to see the monument for two reasons. First, the sampling due to the finite cone spacing in the central fovea^5-7^ imposes a limit to the visual acuity of 2.3 (about 20/9). In this case, a perfect image of the Great Wall would be about one third the size of a single cone excluding pupil diffraction effects. Second, pupil diffraction effects also limit the human visual acuity to 5 (20/4)^6-8^ (for a 6 mm pupil and a 555 nm wavelength). In other words, the edges of the Wall have a spatial frequency that is about two and a half times higher than the cut-off frequency (189 c/deg) of a perfect human eye with a 6 mm pupil. Nevertheless, according to Westheimer experiments^9^, the minimum angle subtended by a line for it to be seen from the distance is approximately only 2 seconds of arc. Such angle is smaller than the one subtended by the Great Wall when observed from Space. Westherimer... 's results are based on the detection of a black line against a bright background; in this scenario, the black line causes a local dip in the luminance of the image, which makes it possible for the eye to detect it. Such a great local change in luminance also makes the detection of the stars at night possible (if bright enough), as does the reflection of the sun in a small distant mirror (as used in a boat to indicate its position). Therefore, in principle, if the Great Wall reflected the sunlight as a long mirror or it were self-illuminated with high-power lamps it could probably be seen form Space. However, in this hypothetical case, the astronaut would not be seeing the Wall but either the lamps or the sunlight reflection. Moreover, natural sun reflection would be very unlikely due to the type of material it was built with (limestone, clay, granite and brick).\n\nObviously, it would be even less likely to see the Great Wall from the moon, situated at a minimum distance of 350,000 km, because the visual acuity would have to be 17,000 times (!) better than that of the normal human eye (in this case it would amount to seeing the cable from a distance of more than 1000 km). In this sense, if the question was: “Could we see the Great Wall of China at a simple glance from Space?” The answer would also have to be “no”, because an astronaut located on the limit of the atmosphere, about 80 km (50 miles) away, would need a visual acuity of approximately 3.9 (about 20/5) to be able to see it.... As a simple exercise, Google Earth^©^ can be used to see the Wall at lat.=40.48234, lon.=116.180592 if one is close enough to the ground. However, once you are more than 40 miles away, it cannot be seen. This simple experiment does not really answer the question since the visualization of the Wall will depends not only on our vision, but also on the satelite image resolution, our computer screen, etc. Despite this, it can be observed that, at a height of 40 miles, the Wall is not visible but the landing runway of the Yongning Airport, located about 4 miles WNW to the Wall, is. Moreover, if the Great Wall was visible from Space, then, contrary to common claims, it would not be the only visible manmade object since astronauts would also enjoy the view of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and probably their own house in case it is more than 6 m wide and long.\n\nFor some unknown reasons (perhaps marketing-related) this belief is one of the “unscientific walls” that has become popular, imposing a false limit to our vision of the world.... - 1.Oyster C.W.

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

Credit: Canva\n\n“The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure that is visible from space.” As kids, this was one of the most popular statements that made us wonder at the sheer size of this wall. And this statement has stuck around for a long time; in fact from before the first man planted his feet on the moon. In 1754, English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"\n\nBut the answer is simple and this persistent myth has been debunked countless times by astronauts and scientists alike, specifically by those who have actually been to space - NO.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n## The Great Wall Is Not Visible From Space To The Naked Eye\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall is visible from space has captured the public imagination for decades. Its sheer length and historical significance contribute to this misconception. However, the vastness of space and the relatively small size of the wall compared to the Earth make it impossible to see without advanced optical equipment.\n\nEven from the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits relatively close to Earth, the Great Wall is barely distinguishable without high-powered cameras and zoom lenses. Astronauts have consistently reported that other man-made structures, such as large cities or highways, are far more visible from orbit.\n\nThe Great Wall, while impressive in scale, is simply too narrow and blends in too much with its surroundings to be seen by the human eye from the perspective of space.... ## Are Any Other Structures Visible From Space?Yes. While the Great Wall of China is not visible from space, plenty of other human-made structures can be seen from orbit. The Pyramids of Giza, for example, are famously visible from the International Space Station, as photographed during Expedition 32.

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

              "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).... To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.\n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.... ### Ming Great Wall\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From here, the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There, at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关,\n\n*Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.... *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城,\n\n*Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of\n\n*Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the\n\n*China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

The current English name evolved from accounts of \"the Chinese wall\" from early modern European travelers. By the nineteenth century, \"the Great Wall of China\" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as \"the Chinese wall\".... When China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.... ### Han Great Wall\n\nHan fortifications start from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu (t 馬迷途, s 马迷途, *Mǎmítú*, l \"horses losing their way\") near Yumen Pass.... The sections of the Great Wall around Beijing, were frequently renovated, and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, as it was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China; foreign dignitaries would be shown this section on visits to the Great Wall. The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated. South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 m (25 ft 7 in) high and 5 m (16 ft 5 in) wide.\n\nOne of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling. There it runs 11 km (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 m (16 ft 5 in to 26 ft 3 in) in height, and 6 m (19 ft 8 in) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 m (16 ft 5 in) across the top. Wangjing Lou (t 望京樓, s 望京楼, *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level.

The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's Wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of *Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the *China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

              "snippet": "Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space? This intriguing question has fascinated many for years, blending the allure of an ancient wonder with the marvels of space exploration. The Great Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Despite its impressive size, the visibility of the Great Wall from space is a more complex issue than it may seem, involving factors like distance, color, lighting, and the capabilities of human vision and technology.... ## Understanding The Visibility Factors\n\nThe question of whether you can see the Great Wall of China from space encompasses several\n\n**visibility factors**. To grasp this better, it’s essential to break down the elements that influence what astronauts can observe from low Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n### Distance from Earth’s Surface\n\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits approximately 240 miles above Earth, have a limited visibility range. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions can obscure smaller structures. While the Great Wall spans vast distances, distinguishing its segments among the varied landscape can be challenging.\n\n### Color and Contrast\n\nThe\n\n**great wall’s color** also plays a vital role in its visibility from space. Constructed primarily with earth and stone materials that blend well with the surrounding terrain, the wall often camouflages against the landscape. Unlike brighter man-made structures or urban areas, the wall’s earthy tones diminish its prominence in photographs taken from space.... ### Weather and Atmospheric Conditions\n\nWeather conditions can significantly affect visibility. Clear skies are essential for remarkable space views. Clouds, rain, and atmospheric haze can obscure the wall and other ground features. Additionally, light plays a critical role; during sunset or sunrise, shadows can help highlight or obscure the wall’s structure.... ## Astronaut Accounts and Visual Confirmation\n\nThough many astronauts have reported seeing landmarks from space, specific references to the Great Wall are rare. According to various accounts, while some astronauts have claimed glimpses of the Great Wall, they describe it as extremely thin and indistinct, often blending in with the natural landscape.\n\n### Notable Astronaut Quotes\n\n**Chris Hadfield**, a Canadian astronaut, mentioned in interviews and on social media platforms that, while you can see some features of the Great Wall, identifying it without prior knowledge is extremely difficult. **Andrew R. Morgan**, another astronaut, noted that various extensions of the wall are challenging to distinguish from other geographical features.\n\nThese statements reflect a common sentiment among astronauts: while the Great Wall is a remarkable structure on Earth, its visibility from space isn’t what most people might expect.... ## Technological Advancements in Satellite Imaging\n\nAs technology has evolved, so have the capabilities of satellite imaging. Modern satellites can capture high-resolution images of Earth, allowing scientists and researchers to study the Great Wall from beyond the atmosphere.... ### Satellite Imagery and Mapping\n\nSeveral satellites equipped with sophisticated sensors can detect structures on Earth’s surface. These images often highlight changes in land use, urban sprawl, and historical sites like the Great Wall. However, the technical capability to ‘see’ the wall does not equate to simple visibility by the naked eye.\n\n\n\n**Satellite** | **Capabilities** | **Purpose** |... |————————-|———————————————————|——————————————————–|\n| Landsat (NASA) | Medium-resolution images (30m pixels) | Earth observation, environmental observation |\n| WorldView-3 | High-resolution images (31cm pixels) | Urban planning, disaster response |\n| SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) | High-resolution and multispectral images | Agricultural monitoring, forestry management |\nModern satellites, like WorldView-3, possess extremely high-resolution imaging capabilities, allowing researchers to identify natural and artificial structures—including the Great Wall—more clearly. This advancement raises the question of technological versus physical visibility.... ## The Great Wall and Global Awareness\n\nThe Great Wall of China serves as a symbol of cultural pride and historical significance. Its immense scale is part of its charm and enduring fascination.\n\n**Understanding the wall’s impact** on global culture and tourism reveals why seeing it from space, while challenging, is still a significant inquiry.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nConstructed over several dynasties, the\n\n**Great Wall’s purpose** was multifold. Primarily built for defense, it also played a key role in facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors annually. Its preservation and restoration have become vital issues, ensuring this architectural marvel remains part of human heritage.\n\n### Tourism and Global Studies\n\nTourism is a significant aspect of the Great Wall’s legacy. Millions visit every year to walk its lengths and experience its history. From a global perspective, the Great Wall also becomes a subject of study for environmental scientists and historians examining its interactions with modern development and climate change.... ## Conclusion: The Reality of Visibility\n\nthe inquiry of\n\n**Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space?** has nuanced answers. While certain **high-resolution satellite images** can identify aspects of the wall, visually locating it from the **International Space Station** proves to be intricate due to various factors such as distance, color blending, and atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe Great Wall continues to inspire awe and curiosity, serving not only as a monumental structure but also as a rich part of cultural heritage that invites exploration, understanding, and preservation. For those intrigued by the complexities of visibility from space and the wonders of our planet, the Great Wall stands as a testament to human ingenuity, offering further avenues for exploration—be it from above or on foot along its storied paths.\n\nFor further detailed observations and scientific insights on satellite imaging technologies, view more at NASA Satellite Imagery Science and to explore global cultural heritage, visit UNESCO’s Great Wall Page.",

              "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

Liwie's observation contradicted the information previously presented in several books, board games and various television contests, to quote a few examples. After Liwie's declarations, the Chinese government asked for his statement to be removed from various reports.\n\nThe problem arose a few months later when the American astronaut Eugene Cernan stated at a conference that according to the news from the European Space Agency (ESA) issued on the last 11^th^ of May, in an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. Various international newspapers rushed to explain that Cernan attributed his colleague Liwie's error to bad atmospheric and/or lighting conditions at the moment of his observation.... In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published together with Cernan's declarations a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another communication from the ESA dated the 19^th^ of May 2004 (no longer available in the ESA's website) acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! The ESA had been warned of its error by Mr. Albert Kisskoy, Pr. Gary Li of the University of the State of California and Dr. Zhimin Man from the Fundan University of Shangai.... After this little uproar it is still unclear for some people whether the myth is true or not. In order to answer this question, it is not necessary to go into Space and look: it suffices to know a little about the human visual system and its limits. Not even the best of human eyes at a simple glace could see the Great Wall of China from Space. The impossibility is due to the limitation of the human eye when it comes to seeing small diffusing objects. The relevant parameter is not the Wall'... s length (about 7300 km), but its width, which is usually less than 6 m. See Figure 1. To illustrate this with a simple example, looking at the Great Wall from a distance of 160 km would be the same as looking at a 2 cm diameter cable from more than half a kilometre away! No matter how good the atmospheric conditions, lighting and contrast are —unless the object was self-illuminated or it reflected the sun as a small mirror— it would be totally impossible to see this cable (or, for similar reasons, the Great Wall) at a simple glance, because the eye would need a visual acuity greater than approximately 20/3, which is 7.7 times the normal visual acuity^1^, and more than three times the maximum acuity reached by a falcon^2^, an eagle^3^, or a human eye^4^. Even an optically perfect human eye^5-7^ would not be able to see the monument for two reasons. First, the sampling due to the finite cone spacing in the central fovea^5-7^ imposes a limit to the visual acuity of 2.3 (about 20/9). In this case, a perfect image of the Great Wall would be about one third the size of a single cone excluding pupil diffraction effects. Second, pupil diffraction effects also limit the human visual acuity to 5 (20/4)^6-8^ (for a 6 mm pupil and a 555 nm wavelength). In other words, the edges of the Wall have a spatial frequency that is about two and a half times higher than the cut-off frequency (189 c/deg) of a perfect human eye with a 6 mm pupil. Nevertheless, according to Westheimer experiments^9^, the minimum angle subtended by a line for it to be seen from the distance is approximately only 2 seconds of arc. Such angle is smaller than the one subtended by the Great Wall when observed from Space. Westherimer... 's results are based on the detection of a black line against a bright background; in this scenario, the black line causes a local dip in the luminance of the image, which makes it possible for the eye to detect it. Such a great local change in luminance also makes the detection of the stars at night possible (if bright enough), as does the reflection of the sun in a small distant mirror (as used in a boat to indicate its position). Therefore, in principle, if the Great Wall reflected the sunlight as a long mirror or it were self-illuminated with high-power lamps it could probably be seen form Space. However, in this hypothetical case, the astronaut would not be seeing the Wall but either the lamps or the sunlight reflection. Moreover, natural sun reflection would be very unlikely due to the type of material it was built with (limestone, clay, granite and brick).\n\nObviously, it would be even less likely to see the Great Wall from the moon, situated at a minimum distance of 350,000 km, because the visual acuity would have to be 17,000 times (!) better than that of the normal human eye (in this case it would amount to seeing the cable from a distance of more than 1000 km). In this sense, if the question was: “Could we see the Great Wall of China at a simple glance from Space?” The answer would also have to be “no”, because an astronaut located on the limit of the atmosphere, about 80 km (50 miles) away, would need a visual acuity of approximately 3.9 (about 20/5) to be able to see it.... As a simple exercise, Google Earth^©^ can be used to see the Wall at lat.=40.48234, lon.=116.180592 if one is close enough to the ground. However, once you are more than 40 miles away, it cannot be seen. This simple experiment does not really answer the question since the visualization of the Wall will depends not only on our vision, but also on the satelite image resolution, our computer screen, etc. Despite this, it can be observed that, at a height of 40 miles, the Wall is not visible but the landing runway of the Yongning Airport, located about 4 miles WNW to the Wall, is. Moreover, if the Great Wall was visible from Space, then, contrary to common claims, it would not be the only visible manmade object since astronauts would also enjoy the view of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and probably their own house in case it is more than 6 m wide and long.\n\nFor some unknown reasons (perhaps marketing-related) this belief is one of the “unscientific walls” that has become popular, imposing a false limit to our vision of the world.... - 1.Oyster C.W.

The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

              "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas.

              "snippet": "# The Great Wall of China is Visible from Space: A Fact-Check\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe claim that \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space\" has persisted for decades, often cited as a testament to the wall's immense scale. This assertion has been popularized in various forms, including the notion that it is the only man-made structure visible from the Moon. However, the validity of this claim has been scrutinized by experts and scientists. This article explores the evidence surrounding this claim and examines the reliability of the sources that discuss it.\n\n## What We Know\n\n\n\n**Visibility from Space**: The consensus among experts is that the Great Wall of China is not easily visible from space with the naked eye. A 2010 article published in *PMC*states that even the best human eyes cannot see the wall from space due to its narrowness and the surrounding landscape 1.\n\n\n\n**Astronaut Accounts**: Astronauts have reported that the wall is difficult to see from low Earth orbit. For instance, Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, stated that he could not see the wall during his mission in 2003 5.\n\n\n\n**NASA's Position**: NASA has produced images of the Great Wall taken from the International Space Station (ISS), but these images require photographic equipment to capture the structure clearly, indicating that it is not visible to the naked eye 2.\n\n\n\n**Myth Origins**: The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon likely originated from a 1932 cartoon published by Ripley's Believe It or Not! 10. This myth has persisted despite a lack of evidence supporting it.\n\n\n\n**Pollution and Coloration**: Factors such as pollution and the wall's coloration make it even less visible from space. According to *Scientific American*, the wall blends into its surroundings, making it challenging to distinguish from the landscape 6.... ## Analysis\n\nThe sources discussing the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space vary in their credibility and potential biases:\n\n\n\n**Scientific and Academic Sources**: Articles from *Scientific American*and *PMC*provide scientifically grounded perspectives.

They emphasize the distinction between popular belief and scientific reality 38.\n\n\n\n**Potential Bias**: Some sources, such as *Times Now News*and *Jagran Josh*, may have a more sensationalist approach, focusing on the myth's cultural significance rather than providing a rigorous scientific analysis 49. This could lead to a skewed representation of the facts.\n\n\n\n**Methodological Concerns**: While many sources cite astronaut accounts and scientific studies, the methodology behind these claims is not always transparent. For example, how visibility was assessed or the specific conditions under which observations were made are often not detailed.... ## Conclusion\n\n**Verdict: False**\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is false. Key evidence supporting this conclusion includes expert consensus indicating that the wall is too narrow and blends into its surroundings, making it nearly impossible to see with the naked eye from space. Astronaut accounts, including those from Yang Liwei, further corroborate this, as they have reported difficulty in spotting the wall even from low Earth orbit. Additionally, NASA's imagery demonstrates that specialized photographic equipment is necessary to capture the wall clearly, reinforcing the assertion that it is not visible without aid.\n\nIt is important to note that while the myth of the Great Wall's visibility has cultural significance and has been popularized over time, it lacks scientific support. The origins of this myth can be traced back to a 1932 cartoon, which highlights how misinformation can persist despite a lack of evidence.\n\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations in the available evidence. Visibility can depend on various factors, including atmospheric conditions and the observer's location. Thus, while the consensus is clear, there may be specific scenarios where visibility could be marginally improved, though this does not substantiate the claim as a general truth.\n\nReaders are encouraged to critically evaluate information and consider the sources and evidence behind claims, especially those that have become entrenched in popular belief.... ## Sources\n\n- López-Gil, N.

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

's not very wide How wide are we talking typically maybe four to five meters about 15 feet across which sounds like a lot down here but from hundreds of kilometers up it's\ntiny like trying to spot a piece of {ts:95} thread from uh across a football stadium That's a pretty good analogy Yeah It lacks scale in that dimension compare it to say modern highways Some are wider than the wall or city grids especially at night Right The lights make a huge difference Exactly Cities create this massive area of contrast particularly with the lights The wall uh tends to follow the terrain uses natural colors It just doesn't stand out visually We've heard that directly from astronauts haven't we neil Armstrong I think mentioned it Yep Armstrong Chris Hadfield too Many have said it just blends in It doesn't have that sharp contrast you'd need to pick it out against the mountains or the land So other things are easier to see then Oh\ndefinitely Things like airports those long straight runways really stand out {ts:141} big dams reflecting sunlight even large patterns of farmland you know the geometric shapes Okay so it's about contrast and maybe width or overall sprawl not just length Precisely Scale and contrast are key for naked eye visibility from that altitude The walls amazing length doesn't quite translate into visibility without help So if astronauts say no where did this whole visible from space thing even start it feels like it... 's been around forever Well interestingly it actually started before anyone went to space way back in the 19th century No way How just speculation really Western writers like Richard Hallebertton was one often mentioned later were imagining these grand views\nfrom great heights even from the moon sometimes quite fantastically And the Great Wall being this almost mythical {ts:188} structure already It became the prime candidate for what could you see exactly It captured the imagination It seemed plausible this massive feat of engineering being visible from afar And then I guess the space race happens in the 20th century And the idea just got legs It started popping up in like school textbooks travel guides popular science articles almost stated as fact Was there maybe a bit of uh national pride mixed in there too for China maybe Potentially Yeah It's a powerful image isn't it your nation's greatest landmark being visible from the heavens It certainly wouldn't hurt the wall's symbolic status And did China actively\npromote it or just let the idea run it seems for a while it wasn't really challenged and perhaps was seen as you know a positive thing But then came a {ts:234} really key moment in 2003 Ah right Shenzu 5 Yes China's first astronaut Yang Leewi He went up came back and people asked him directly \"Did you see the Great Wall?\"...  And his answer he said no He couldn't pick it out with the naked eye Wow That must have caused a stir It definitely did It led to a lot of discussion within China and internationally It was a firsthand account from their own astronaut kind of settling the debate or at least shifting it significantly So naked eye definitely not But that doesn't mean it's impossible to see from space right just not without health Correct That's a\ncrucial distinction with technology Yes absolutely high resolution cameras on satellites or astronauts using telephoto lenses from the ISS They can image the wall Okay so you need zoom basically or {ts:285} satellite imagery and good conditions You need clear weather maybe the sun angle creating shadows that help define the structure It's not like you just glance out the window and there it is right it requires specific tech and circumstances Very different from the popular myth of just looking down and spotting it easily Totally different So why does this distinction even matter okay it's a myth We busted it Does it change anything i think it does actually It kind of highlights how easily stories especially really cool ones can take root and become accepted facts even when\nthe evidence isn't there Like fact and feeling get intertwined Yeah something like that The idea of seeing the wall is so appealing It feels like it should be true It makes you wonder what other things we accept You know it... 's a good {ts:328} point And maybe focusing just on the visibility thing distracts from what's truly amazing about the wall I think so You get caught up in can you see it can't you see it and you might miss the incredible history the centuries of labor the stories embedded in those stones the cultures it connected or divided the real significance Exactly Debunking the myth lets us appreciate the wall for its actual historical and cultural weight and maybe appreciate the things we can see from space the city lights the patterns of farming even\nunfortunately things like deforestation We actually got some insight on this from Dr Sarah Lynn a historian who specializes in Chinese architecture Oh interesting What did she say well she echoed that point about the myth's power coming from the wall's symbolic weight {ts:373} Plus like you said that early speculation just filling a vacuum before we had real observations It just sounded right Makes sense But she also stressed that the wall's legacy is so much more than just defense She talked about it being a hub for centuries of innovation incredible human effort Yes But also cultural exchange So not just keeping people out but also facilitating things Yeah Like trade routes communication lines even diplomacy happened along or the wall systems It's a much more\ncomplex picture than just a barrier that really broadens the perspective Fascinating Okay so before we wrap up let... 's do a quick myth versus fact round based on what we've covered Ready let's do it Claim one The Great Wall was built in just one century True or false uh it's definitely false It was built over {ts:418} a huge span more than 2,000 years with the Ming dynasty responsible for a lot of the most famous sections Okay Claim two The wall is a single continuous structure from end to end True or false also false It's more like a system sections of wall fortifications watchtowers sometimes using natural features like mountains And there are gaps not one solid line Got it And claim three the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage site True or false that one is\ntrue Designated back in 1987 for its huge cultural importance Perfect So pulling it all together the main takeaway the Great Wall is undeniably one of humanity's most incredible achievements its scale its history staggering But uh the popular idea about seeing it from space with the naked eye that part's a myth Simple as that But {ts:467} knowing that hopefully lets you appreciate its true story even more Absolutely Understanding the reality doesn't diminish the wall It just clarifies what makes it so significant So we definitely encourage you our listeners to maybe dig a little deeper into the wall's actual history It's way more interesting than just the visibility question For sure And maybe as a final thought think about other... facts you hear repeated often How many might be like this one a compelling story that blends fact and feeling but doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny A good challenge Always worth asking where our information comes from",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

These spaceborne radar images show a segment of the Great Wall of China in a desert region of north-central China, about 700 kilometers (434 miles) west of Beijing. The wall appears as a thin orange band, running from the top to the bottom of the color image on the left. The black and white images on the right correspond to the area outlined by the box and represent the four radar channels of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C). Each channel is sensitive to different aspects of the terrain, including two generations of the Great Wall. The L-band image (24 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted and horizontally received polarizations) provides the clearest image of the two wall segments. The bright continuous line running from top to bottom in this image is the younger wall, built during the Ming Dynasty about 600 years ago. Immediately to the right of this wall is a bright discontinuous line that is the remnant of an older version of the wall, built during the Sui Dynasty, about 1500 years ago.... The two generations of the wall are seen less distinctly in the L-band image (horizontally transmitted, vertically received) and C-band image (6 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted, horizontally received). Orchards and other trees lining a road parallel to the wall show up as bright rectangles on the these two images because the L and C channels are sensitive to complex vegetation structure. The Ming Dynasty wall is between 5 meters and 8 meters high (16 feet to 26 feet) in these areas. The entire wall is about 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) long, but only a 75-kilometer (45.5-mile) long segment is shown in this image. The wall is easily detected from space by radar because its steep, smooth sides provide a prominent surface for reflection of the radar beam. Detection of the remnant Sui Dynasty wall by radar is allowing Chinese researchers to trace the former location of the wall across vast and remote areas. In some areas, the Sui wall is buried by sand that has been blown across the desert.... The images were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 10, 1994. The left image is centered at 37.7 degrees north latitude and 107.5 degrees east longitude. North is toward the upper right. The left image shows an area 25 kilometers by 75 kilometers (15.5 miles by 45.5 miles), and the right images show an area 3.1 kilometers by 2.2 kilometers (1.9 miles by 1.4 miles). The colors in the left image are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L- band, horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received; blue is C-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program.\n\nNASA JPL\n\nPublished October 4, 1994\n\nData acquired October 4, 1994",

But is it actually true or busted?\n\nIn this inaugural episode of Fact or Fiction Foundry's True or Busted? series, we dive deep into one of the world's most famous misconceptions.

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

              "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Thank you for being part of our cultural journey!... {ts:0} [Music] is the Great Wall of China really\n{ts:13} visible from space. Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "J Optom. 2010 Nov 4;1(1):3–4. doi: 10.3921/joptom.2008.3... # Is it Really Possible to See the Great Wall of China from Space with a Naked Eye?\n\nNorberto López-Gil\n\n^1^Ciencias de la Visión.Universidad de Murcia 30100 Murcia (Spain)\n\n^1^\n\n^1^Ciencias de la Visión.Universidad de Murcia 30100 Murcia (Spain)\n\nIssue date 2008.\n\nPMCID: PMC3972694\n\n*Dear Editor:*\n\nIn October 2003, after the first Chinese astronaut Yang Liwie returned from his first journey into Space, a popular belief was apparently called into question when he stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. Liwie's observation contradicted the information previously presented in several books, board games and various television contests, to quote a few examples. After Liwie's declarations, the Chinese government asked for his statement to be removed from various reports.\n\nThe problem arose a few months later when the American astronaut Eugene Cernan stated at a conference that according to the news from the European Space Agency (ESA) issued on the last 11^th^ of May, in an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. Various international newspapers rushed to explain that Cernan attributed his colleague Liwie's error to bad atmospheric and/or lighting conditions at the moment of his observation.... In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published together with Cernan's declarations a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another communication from the ESA dated the 19^th^ of May 2004 (no longer available in the ESA's website) acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! The ESA had been warned of its error by Mr. Albert Kisskoy, Pr. Gary Li of the University of the State of California and Dr. Zhimin Man from the Fundan University of Shangai.... After this little uproar it is still unclear for some people whether the myth is true or not. In order to answer this question, it is not necessary to go into Space and look: it suffices to know a little about the human visual system and its limits. Not even the best of human eyes at a simple glace could see the Great Wall of China from Space. The impossibility is due to the limitation of the human eye when it comes to seeing small diffusing objects. The relevant parameter is not the Wall'... s length (about 7300 km), but its width, which is usually less than 6 m. See Figure 1. To illustrate this with a simple example, looking at the Great Wall from a distance of 160 km would be the same as looking at a 2 cm diameter cable from more than half a kilometre away! No matter how good the atmospheric conditions, lighting and contrast are —unless the object was self-illuminated or it reflected the sun as a small mirror— it would be totally impossible to see this cable (or, for similar reasons, the Great Wall) at a simple glance, because the eye would need a visual acuity greater than approximately 20/3, which is 7.7 times the normal visual acuity^1^, and more than three times the maximum acuity reached by a falcon^2^, an eagle^3^, or a human eye^4^. Even an optically perfect human eye^5-7^ would not be able to see the monument for two reasons. First, the sampling due to the finite cone spacing in the central fovea^5-7^ imposes a limit to the visual acuity of 2.3 (about 20/9). In this case, a perfect image of the Great Wall would be about one third the size of a single cone excluding pupil diffraction effects. Second, pupil diffraction effects also limit the human visual acuity to 5 (20/4)^6-8^ (for a 6 mm pupil and a 555 nm wavelength). In other words, the edges of the Wall have a spatial frequency that is about two and a half times higher than the cut-off frequency (189 c/deg) of a perfect human eye with a 6 mm pupil. Nevertheless, according to Westheimer experiments^9^, the minimum angle subtended by a line for it to be seen from the distance is approximately only 2 seconds of arc. Such angle is smaller than the one subtended by the Great Wall when observed from Space. Westherimer... 's results are based on the detection of a black line against a bright background; in this scenario, the black line causes a local dip in the luminance of the image, which makes it possible for the eye to detect it. Such a great local change in luminance also makes the detection of the stars at night possible (if bright enough), as does the reflection of the sun in a small distant mirror (as used in a boat to indicate its position). Therefore, in principle, if the Great Wall reflected the sunlight as a long mirror or it were self-illuminated with high-power lamps it could probably be seen form Space. However, in this hypothetical case, the astronaut would not be seeing the Wall but either the lamps or the sunlight reflection. Moreover, natural sun reflection would be very unlikely due to the type of material it was built with (limestone, clay, granite and brick).\n\nObviously, it would be even less likely to see the Great Wall from the moon, situated at a minimum distance of 350,000 km, because the visual acuity would have to be 17,000 times (!) better than that of the normal human eye (in this case it would amount to seeing the cable from a distance of more than 1000 km). In this sense, if the question was: “Could we see the Great Wall of China at a simple glance from Space?” The answer would also have to be “no”, because an astronaut located on the limit of the atmosphere, about 80 km (50 miles) away, would need a visual acuity of approximately 3.9 (about 20/5) to be able to see it.... As a simple exercise, Google Earth^©^ can be used to see the Wall at lat.=40.48234, lon.=116.180592 if one is close enough to the ground. However, once you are more than 40 miles away, it cannot be seen. This simple experiment does not really answer the question since the visualization of the Wall will depends not only on our vision, but also on the satelite image resolution, our computer screen, etc. Despite this, it can be observed that, at a height of 40 miles, the Wall is not visible but the landing runway of the Yongning Airport, located about 4 miles WNW to the Wall, is. Moreover, if the Great Wall was visible from Space, then, contrary to common claims, it would not be the only visible manmade object since astronauts would also enjoy the view of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and probably their own house in case it is more than 6 m wide and long.\n\nFor some unknown reasons (perhaps marketing-related) this belief is one of the “unscientific walls” that has become popular, imposing a false limit to our vision of the world.... - 1.Oyster C.W.

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

              "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Thank you for being part of our cultural journey!... {ts:0} [Music] is the Great Wall of China really\n{ts:13} visible from space. Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).... To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.\n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.... ### Ming Great Wall\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From here, the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There, at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关,\n\n*Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.... *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城,\n\n*Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of\n\n*Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the\n\n*China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

The current English name evolved from accounts of \"the Chinese wall\" from early modern European travelers. By the nineteenth century, \"the Great Wall of China\" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as \"the Chinese wall\".... When China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.... ### Han Great Wall\n\nHan fortifications start from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu (t 馬迷途, s 马迷途, *Mǎmítú*, l \"horses losing their way\") near Yumen Pass.... The sections of the Great Wall around Beijing, were frequently renovated, and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, as it was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China; foreign dignitaries would be shown this section on visits to the Great Wall. The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated. South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 m (25 ft 7 in) high and 5 m (16 ft 5 in) wide.\n\nOne of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling. There it runs 11 km (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 m (16 ft 5 in to 26 ft 3 in) in height, and 6 m (19 ft 8 in) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 m (16 ft 5 in) across the top. Wangjing Lou (t 望京樓, s 望京楼, *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level.

              "snippet": "Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space? This intriguing question has fascinated many for years, blending the allure of an ancient wonder with the marvels of space exploration. The Great Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Despite its impressive size, the visibility of the Great Wall from space is a more complex issue than it may seem, involving factors like distance, color, lighting, and the capabilities of human vision and technology.... ## Understanding The Visibility Factors\n\nThe question of whether you can see the Great Wall of China from space encompasses several\n\n**visibility factors**. To grasp this better, it’s essential to break down the elements that influence what astronauts can observe from low Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n### Distance from Earth’s Surface\n\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits approximately 240 miles above Earth, have a limited visibility range. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions can obscure smaller structures. While the Great Wall spans vast distances, distinguishing its segments among the varied landscape can be challenging.\n\n### Color and Contrast\n\nThe\n\n**great wall’s color** also plays a vital role in its visibility from space. Constructed primarily with earth and stone materials that blend well with the surrounding terrain, the wall often camouflages against the landscape. Unlike brighter man-made structures or urban areas, the wall’s earthy tones diminish its prominence in photographs taken from space.... ### Weather and Atmospheric Conditions\n\nWeather conditions can significantly affect visibility. Clear skies are essential for remarkable space views. Clouds, rain, and atmospheric haze can obscure the wall and other ground features. Additionally, light plays a critical role; during sunset or sunrise, shadows can help highlight or obscure the wall’s structure.... ## Astronaut Accounts and Visual Confirmation\n\nThough many astronauts have reported seeing landmarks from space, specific references to the Great Wall are rare. According to various accounts, while some astronauts have claimed glimpses of the Great Wall, they describe it as extremely thin and indistinct, often blending in with the natural landscape.\n\n### Notable Astronaut Quotes\n\n**Chris Hadfield**, a Canadian astronaut, mentioned in interviews and on social media platforms that, while you can see some features of the Great Wall, identifying it without prior knowledge is extremely difficult. **Andrew R. Morgan**, another astronaut, noted that various extensions of the wall are challenging to distinguish from other geographical features.\n\nThese statements reflect a common sentiment among astronauts: while the Great Wall is a remarkable structure on Earth, its visibility from space isn’t what most people might expect.... ## Technological Advancements in Satellite Imaging\n\nAs technology has evolved, so have the capabilities of satellite imaging. Modern satellites can capture high-resolution images of Earth, allowing scientists and researchers to study the Great Wall from beyond the atmosphere.... ### Satellite Imagery and Mapping\n\nSeveral satellites equipped with sophisticated sensors can detect structures on Earth’s surface. These images often highlight changes in land use, urban sprawl, and historical sites like the Great Wall. However, the technical capability to ‘see’ the wall does not equate to simple visibility by the naked eye.\n\n\n\n**Satellite** | **Capabilities** | **Purpose** |... |————————-|———————————————————|——————————————————–|\n| Landsat (NASA) | Medium-resolution images (30m pixels) | Earth observation, environmental observation |\n| WorldView-3 | High-resolution images (31cm pixels) | Urban planning, disaster response |\n| SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) | High-resolution and multispectral images | Agricultural monitoring, forestry management |\nModern satellites, like WorldView-3, possess extremely high-resolution imaging capabilities, allowing researchers to identify natural and artificial structures—including the Great Wall—more clearly. This advancement raises the question of technological versus physical visibility.... ## The Great Wall and Global Awareness\n\nThe Great Wall of China serves as a symbol of cultural pride and historical significance. Its immense scale is part of its charm and enduring fascination.\n\n**Understanding the wall’s impact** on global culture and tourism reveals why seeing it from space, while challenging, is still a significant inquiry.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nConstructed over several dynasties, the\n\n**Great Wall’s purpose** was multifold. Primarily built for defense, it also played a key role in facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors annually. Its preservation and restoration have become vital issues, ensuring this architectural marvel remains part of human heritage.\n\n### Tourism and Global Studies\n\nTourism is a significant aspect of the Great Wall’s legacy. Millions visit every year to walk its lengths and experience its history. From a global perspective, the Great Wall also becomes a subject of study for environmental scientists and historians examining its interactions with modern development and climate change.... ## Conclusion: The Reality of Visibility\n\nthe inquiry of\n\n**Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space?** has nuanced answers. While certain **high-resolution satellite images** can identify aspects of the wall, visually locating it from the **International Space Station** proves to be intricate due to various factors such as distance, color blending, and atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe Great Wall continues to inspire awe and curiosity, serving not only as a monumental structure but also as a rich part of cultural heritage that invites exploration, understanding, and preservation. For those intrigued by the complexities of visibility from space and the wonders of our planet, the Great Wall stands as a testament to human ingenuity, offering further avenues for exploration—be it from above or on foot along its storied paths.\n\nFor further detailed observations and scientific insights on satellite imaging technologies, view more at NASA Satellite Imagery Science and to explore global cultural heritage, visit UNESCO’s Great Wall Page.",

              "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

              "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected.

              "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

Credit: Canva\n\n“The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure that is visible from space.” As kids, this was one of the most popular statements that made us wonder at the sheer size of this wall. And this statement has stuck around for a long time; in fact from before the first man planted his feet on the moon. In 1754, English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"\n\nBut the answer is simple and this persistent myth has been debunked countless times by astronauts and scientists alike, specifically by those who have actually been to space - NO.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n## The Great Wall Is Not Visible From Space To The Naked Eye\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall is visible from space has captured the public imagination for decades. Its sheer length and historical significance contribute to this misconception. However, the vastness of space and the relatively small size of the wall compared to the Earth make it impossible to see without advanced optical equipment.\n\nEven from the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits relatively close to Earth, the Great Wall is barely distinguishable without high-powered cameras and zoom lenses. Astronauts have consistently reported that other man-made structures, such as large cities or highways, are far more visible from orbit.\n\nThe Great Wall, while impressive in scale, is simply too narrow and blends in too much with its surroundings to be seen by the human eye from the perspective of space.... ## Are Any Other Structures Visible From Space?Yes. While the Great Wall of China is not visible from space, plenty of other human-made structures can be seen from orbit. The Pyramids of Giza, for example, are famously visible from the International Space Station, as photographed during Expedition 32. Some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\n**Mallika Bhagat author**\n\nMallika Bhagat dreams about travelling permanently and writing occasionally.

              "snippet": "#### Space Myth\n\nSince 1904, people have been claiming that the Great Wall of China is so big and so prominent, that it can be seen from the surface of the moon. After years of waiting, Apollo astronauts were able to confirm the authenticity of this claim. Their answer: no.\n\nAlan Bean, of the Apollo 12 mission, recounts that all you can really make out on the Earth are lots of white clouds and snow, some blue patches, a little bit of yellow, and, every once in a while, a patch of green.\n\n“No man-made object is visible at this scale.” — Alan Bean, Apollo 12 astronaut.\n\n#### A Closer Look\n\nThe Chinese space program shook upon learning that their astronaut, Yang Liwei, couldn’t see the wall from space. This at least confirmed the invisibility wasn’t a political conspiracy.\n\nAfter numerous missions to space, by astronauts from countries all over the world, nobody could see the wall. The International Space Station, which is 238,601 miles closer to the Earth than the Moon, or only 0.1% as far away, still offers no view of the Wall with the naked eye.\n\n#### Finally Photographed\n\nIt was Chinese-American astronaut Leroy Chiao who would eventually spot the wall using a camera and 180mm lens. Even then, he could only identify a small portion of it. For refference, the human eye can see about 50mm.\n\nChiao took another photograph using a 400mm lens, and experts were even less sure that he had taken a photo of the actual wall. Favorable snowfall and sunlight had seemed to be largely responsible for photographing the wall the first time.\n\nNASA says the Great Wall is hard to photograph, but low-orbit satellites can use radar to capture it.",

              "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills.

              "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

              "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

              "snippet": "Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space? This intriguing question has fascinated many for years, blending the allure of an ancient wonder with the marvels of space exploration. The Great Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Despite its impressive size, the visibility of the Great Wall from space is a more complex issue than it may seem, involving factors like distance, color, lighting, and the capabilities of human vision and technology.... ## Understanding The Visibility Factors\n\nThe question of whether you can see the Great Wall of China from space encompasses several\n\n**visibility factors**. To grasp this better, it’s essential to break down the elements that influence what astronauts can observe from low Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n### Distance from Earth’s Surface\n\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits approximately 240 miles above Earth, have a limited visibility range. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions can obscure smaller structures. While the Great Wall spans vast distances, distinguishing its segments among the varied landscape can be challenging.\n\n### Color and Contrast\n\nThe\n\n**great wall’s color** also plays a vital role in its visibility from space. Constructed primarily with earth and stone materials that blend well with the surrounding terrain, the wall often camouflages against the landscape. Unlike brighter man-made structures or urban areas, the wall’s earthy tones diminish its prominence in photographs taken from space.... ### Weather and Atmospheric Conditions\n\nWeather conditions can significantly affect visibility. Clear skies are essential for remarkable space views. Clouds, rain, and atmospheric haze can obscure the wall and other ground features. Additionally, light plays a critical role; during sunset or sunrise, shadows can help highlight or obscure the wall’s structure.... ## Astronaut Accounts and Visual Confirmation\n\nThough many astronauts have reported seeing landmarks from space, specific references to the Great Wall are rare. According to various accounts, while some astronauts have claimed glimpses of the Great Wall, they describe it as extremely thin and indistinct, often blending in with the natural landscape.\n\n### Notable Astronaut Quotes\n\n**Chris Hadfield**, a Canadian astronaut, mentioned in interviews and on social media platforms that, while you can see some features of the Great Wall, identifying it without prior knowledge is extremely difficult. **Andrew R. Morgan**, another astronaut, noted that various extensions of the wall are challenging to distinguish from other geographical features.\n\nThese statements reflect a common sentiment among astronauts: while the Great Wall is a remarkable structure on Earth, its visibility from space isn’t what most people might expect.... ## Technological Advancements in Satellite Imaging\n\nAs technology has evolved, so have the capabilities of satellite imaging. Modern satellites can capture high-resolution images of Earth, allowing scientists and researchers to study the Great Wall from beyond the atmosphere.... ### Satellite Imagery and Mapping\n\nSeveral satellites equipped with sophisticated sensors can detect structures on Earth’s surface. These images often highlight changes in land use, urban sprawl, and historical sites like the Great Wall. However, the technical capability to ‘see’ the wall does not equate to simple visibility by the naked eye.\n\n\n\n**Satellite** | **Capabilities** | **Purpose** |... |————————-|———————————————————|——————————————————–|\n| Landsat (NASA) | Medium-resolution images (30m pixels) | Earth observation, environmental observation |\n| WorldView-3 | High-resolution images (31cm pixels) | Urban planning, disaster response |\n| SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) | High-resolution and multispectral images | Agricultural monitoring, forestry management |\nModern satellites, like WorldView-3, possess extremely high-resolution imaging capabilities, allowing researchers to identify natural and artificial structures—including the Great Wall—more clearly. This advancement raises the question of technological versus physical visibility.... ## The Great Wall and Global Awareness\n\nThe Great Wall of China serves as a symbol of cultural pride and historical significance. Its immense scale is part of its charm and enduring fascination.\n\n**Understanding the wall’s impact** on global culture and tourism reveals why seeing it from space, while challenging, is still a significant inquiry.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nConstructed over several dynasties, the\n\n**Great Wall’s purpose** was multifold. Primarily built for defense, it also played a key role in facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors annually. Its preservation and restoration have become vital issues, ensuring this architectural marvel remains part of human heritage.\n\n### Tourism and Global Studies\n\nTourism is a significant aspect of the Great Wall’s legacy. Millions visit every year to walk its lengths and experience its history. From a global perspective, the Great Wall also becomes a subject of study for environmental scientists and historians examining its interactions with modern development and climate change.... ## Conclusion: The Reality of Visibility\n\nthe inquiry of\n\n**Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space?** has nuanced answers. While certain **high-resolution satellite images** can identify aspects of the wall, visually locating it from the **International Space Station** proves to be intricate due to various factors such as distance, color blending, and atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe Great Wall continues to inspire awe and curiosity, serving not only as a monumental structure but also as a rich part of cultural heritage that invites exploration, understanding, and preservation. For those intrigued by the complexities of visibility from space and the wonders of our planet, the Great Wall stands as a testament to human ingenuity, offering further avenues for exploration—be it from above or on foot along its storied paths.\n\nFor further detailed observations and scientific insights on satellite imaging technologies, view more at NASA Satellite Imagery Science and to explore global cultural heritage, visit UNESCO’s Great Wall Page.",

              "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

              "snippet": "# The Great Wall of China is Visible from Space: A Fact-Check\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe claim that \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space\" has persisted for decades, often cited as a testament to the wall's immense scale. This assertion has been popularized in various forms, including the notion that it is the only man-made structure visible from the Moon. However, the validity of this claim has been scrutinized by experts and scientists. This article explores the evidence surrounding this claim and examines the reliability of the sources that discuss it.\n\n## What We Know\n\n\n\n**Visibility from Space**: The consensus among experts is that the Great Wall of China is not easily visible from space with the naked eye. A 2010 article published in *PMC*states that even the best human eyes cannot see the wall from space due to its narrowness and the surrounding landscape 1.\n\n\n\n**Astronaut Accounts**: Astronauts have reported that the wall is difficult to see from low Earth orbit. For instance, Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, stated that he could not see the wall during his mission in 2003 5.\n\n\n\n**NASA's Position**: NASA has produced images of the Great Wall taken from the International Space Station (ISS), but these images require photographic equipment to capture the structure clearly, indicating that it is not visible to the naked eye 2.\n\n\n\n**Myth Origins**: The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon likely originated from a 1932 cartoon published by Ripley's Believe It or Not! 10. This myth has persisted despite a lack of evidence supporting it.\n\n\n\n**Pollution and Coloration**: Factors such as pollution and the wall's coloration make it even less visible from space. According to *Scientific American*, the wall blends into its surroundings, making it challenging to distinguish from the landscape 6.... ## Analysis\n\nThe sources discussing the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space vary in their credibility and potential biases:\n\n\n\n**Scientific and Academic Sources**: Articles from *Scientific American*and *PMC*provide scientifically grounded perspectives. They rely on expert opinions and empirical evidence, making them reliable for understanding the limitations of human vision and the challenges of visibility from space 16.\n\n\n\n**NASA**: As a leading authority in space exploration, NASA's images and statements carry significant weight. Their documentation of the Great Wall, while visually impressive, reinforces the idea that visibility is not feasible without specialized equipment 2.\n\n\n\n**Popular Media**: Sources like *Snopes*and *Britannica*offer fact-checking perspectives that clarify the myth's origins and its perpetuation over time. They emphasize the distinction between popular belief and scientific reality 38.\n\n\n\n**Potential Bias**: Some sources, such as *Times Now News*and *Jagran Josh*, may have a more sensationalist approach, focusing on the myth's cultural significance rather than providing a rigorous scientific analysis 49. This could lead to a skewed representation of the facts.\n\n\n\n**Methodological Concerns**: While many sources cite astronaut accounts and scientific studies, the methodology behind these claims is not always transparent. For example, how visibility was assessed or the specific conditions under which observations were made are often not detailed.... ## Conclusion\n\n**Verdict: False**\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is false. Key evidence supporting this conclusion includes expert consensus indicating that the wall is too narrow and blends into its surroundings, making it nearly impossible to see with the naked eye from space. Astronaut accounts, including those from Yang Liwei, further corroborate this, as they have reported difficulty in spotting the wall even from low Earth orbit. Additionally, NASA's imagery demonstrates that specialized photographic equipment is necessary to capture the wall clearly, reinforcing the assertion that it is not visible without aid.\n\nIt is important to note that while the myth of the Great Wall's visibility has cultural significance and has been popularized over time, it lacks scientific support. The origins of this myth can be traced back to a 1932 cartoon, which highlights how misinformation can persist despite a lack of evidence.\n\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations in the available evidence. Visibility can depend on various factors, including atmospheric conditions and the observer's location. Thus, while the consensus is clear, there may be specific scenarios where visibility could be marginally improved, though this does not substantiate the claim as a general truth.\n\nReaders are encouraged to critically evaluate information and consider the sources and evidence behind claims, especially those that have become entrenched in popular belief.... ## Sources\n\n- López-Gil, N.

            "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

's not very wide How wide are we talking typically maybe four to five meters about 15 feet across which sounds like a lot down here but from hundreds of kilometers up it's\ntiny like trying to spot a piece of {ts:95} thread from uh across a football stadium That's a pretty good analogy Yeah It lacks scale in that dimension compare it to say modern highways Some are wider than the wall or city grids especially at night Right The lights make a huge difference Exactly Cities create this massive area of contrast particularly with the lights The wall uh tends to follow the terrain uses natural colors It just doesn't stand out visually We've heard that directly from astronauts haven't we neil Armstrong I think mentioned it Yep Armstrong Chris Hadfield too Many have said it just blends in It doesn't have that sharp contrast you'd need to pick it out against the mountains or the land So other things are easier to see then Oh\ndefinitely Things like airports those long straight runways really stand out {ts:141} big dams reflecting sunlight even large patterns of farmland you know the geometric shapes Okay so it's about contrast and maybe width or overall sprawl not just length Precisely Scale and contrast are key for naked eye visibility from that altitude The walls amazing length doesn't quite translate into visibility without help So if astronauts say no where did this whole visible from space thing even start it feels like it... 's been around forever Well interestingly it actually started before anyone went to space way back in the 19th century No way How just speculation really Western writers like Richard Hallebertton was one often mentioned later were imagining these grand views\nfrom great heights even from the moon sometimes quite fantastically And the Great Wall being this almost mythical {ts:188} structure already It became the prime candidate for what could you see exactly It captured the imagination It seemed plausible this massive feat of engineering being visible from afar And then I guess the space race happens in the 20th century And the idea just got legs It started popping up in like school textbooks travel guides popular science articles almost stated as fact Was there maybe a bit of uh national pride mixed in there too for China maybe Potentially Yeah It's a powerful image isn't it your nation's greatest landmark being visible from the heavens It certainly wouldn't hurt the wall's symbolic status And did China actively\npromote it or just let the idea run it seems for a while it wasn't really challenged and perhaps was seen as you know a positive thing But then came a {ts:234} really key moment in 2003 Ah right Shenzu 5 Yes China's first astronaut Yang Leewi He went up came back and people asked him directly \"Did you see the Great Wall?\"...  And his answer he said no He couldn't pick it out with the naked eye Wow That must have caused a stir It definitely did It led to a lot of discussion within China and internationally It was a firsthand account from their own astronaut kind of settling the debate or at least shifting it significantly So naked eye definitely not But that doesn't mean it's impossible to see from space right just not without health Correct That's a\ncrucial distinction with technology Yes absolutely high resolution cameras on satellites or astronauts using telephoto lenses from the ISS They can image the wall Okay so you need zoom basically or {ts:285} satellite imagery and good conditions You need clear weather maybe the sun angle creating shadows that help define the structure It's not like you just glance out the window and there it is right it requires specific tech and circumstances Very different from the popular myth of just looking down and spotting it easily Totally different So why does this distinction even matter okay it's a myth We busted it Does it change anything i think it does actually It kind of highlights how easily stories especially really cool ones can take root and become accepted facts even when\nthe evidence isn't there Like fact and feeling get intertwined Yeah something like that The idea of seeing the wall is so appealing It feels like it should be true It makes you wonder what other things we accept You know it... 's a good {ts:328} point And maybe focusing just on the visibility thing distracts from what's truly amazing about the wall I think so You get caught up in can you see it can't you see it and you might miss the incredible history the centuries of labor the stories embedded in those stones the cultures it connected or divided the real significance Exactly Debunking the myth lets us appreciate the wall for its actual historical and cultural weight and maybe appreciate the things we can see from space the city lights the patterns of farming even\nunfortunately things like deforestation We actually got some insight on this from Dr Sarah Lynn a historian who specializes in Chinese architecture Oh interesting What did she say well she echoed that point about the myth's power coming from the wall's symbolic weight {ts:373} Plus like you said that early speculation just filling a vacuum before we had real observations It just sounded right Makes sense But she also stressed that the wall's legacy is so much more than just defense She talked about it being a hub for centuries of innovation incredible human effort Yes But also cultural exchange So not just keeping people out but also facilitating things Yeah Like trade routes communication lines even diplomacy happened along or the wall systems It's a much more\ncomplex picture than just a barrier that really broadens the perspective Fascinating Okay so before we wrap up let... 's do a quick myth versus fact round based on what we've covered Ready let's do it Claim one The Great Wall was built in just one century True or false uh it's definitely false It was built over {ts:418} a huge span more than 2,000 years with the Ming dynasty responsible for a lot of the most famous sections Okay Claim two The wall is a single continuous structure from end to end True or false also false It's more like a system sections of wall fortifications watchtowers sometimes using natural features like mountains And there are gaps not one solid line Got it And claim three the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage site True or false that one is\ntrue Designated back in 1987 for its huge cultural importance Perfect So pulling it all together the main takeaway the Great Wall is undeniably one of humanity's most incredible achievements its scale its history staggering But uh the popular idea about seeing it from space with the naked eye that part's a myth Simple as that But {ts:467} knowing that hopefully lets you appreciate its true story even more Absolutely Understanding the reality doesn't diminish the wall It just clarifies what makes it so significant So we definitely encourage you our listeners to maybe dig a little deeper into the wall's actual history It's way more interesting than just the visibility question For sure And maybe as a final thought think about other... facts you hear repeated often How many might be like this one a compelling story that blends fact and feeling but doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny A good challenge Always worth asking where our information comes from",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

            "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

            "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969.

            "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

            "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

            "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

            "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

            "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

These spaceborne radar images show a segment of the Great Wall of China in a desert region of north-central China, about 700 kilometers (434 miles) west of Beijing. The wall appears as a thin orange band, running from the top to the bottom of the color image on the left. The black and white images on the right correspond to the area outlined by the box and represent the four radar channels of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C). Each channel is sensitive to different aspects of the terrain, including two generations of the Great Wall. The L-band image (24 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted and horizontally received polarizations) provides the clearest image of the two wall segments. The bright continuous line running from top to bottom in this image is the younger wall, built during the Ming Dynasty about 600 years ago. Immediately to the right of this wall is a bright discontinuous line that is the remnant of an older version of the wall, built during the Sui Dynasty, about 1500 years ago.... The two generations of the wall are seen less distinctly in the L-band image (horizontally transmitted, vertically received) and C-band image (6 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted, horizontally received). Orchards and other trees lining a road parallel to the wall show up as bright rectangles on the these two images because the L and C channels are sensitive to complex vegetation structure. The Ming Dynasty wall is between 5 meters and 8 meters high (16 feet to 26 feet) in these areas. The entire wall is about 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) long, but only a 75-kilometer (45.5-mile) long segment is shown in this image. The wall is easily detected from space by radar because its steep, smooth sides provide a prominent surface for reflection of the radar beam. Detection of the remnant Sui Dynasty wall by radar is allowing Chinese researchers to trace the former location of the wall across vast and remote areas. In some areas, the Sui wall is buried by sand that has been blown across the desert.... The images were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 10, 1994. The left image is centered at 37.7 degrees north latitude and 107.5 degrees east longitude. North is toward the upper right. The left image shows an area 25 kilometers by 75 kilometers (15.5 miles by 45.5 miles), and the right images show an area 3.1 kilometers by 2.2 kilometers (1.9 miles by 1.4 miles). The colors in the left image are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L- band, horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received; blue is C-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program.\n\nNASA JPL\n\nPublished October 4, 1994\n\nData acquired October 4, 1994",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing.

When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

            "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

            "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

            "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas.

            "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

            "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

Liwie's observation contradicted the information previously presented in several books, board games and various television contests, to quote a few examples. After Liwie's declarations, the Chinese government asked for his statement to be removed from various reports.\n\nThe problem arose a few months later when the American astronaut Eugene Cernan stated at a conference that according to the news from the European Space Agency (ESA) issued on the last 11^th^ of May, in an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. Various international newspapers rushed to explain that Cernan attributed his colleague Liwie's error to bad atmospheric and/or lighting conditions at the moment of his observation.... In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published together with Cernan's declarations a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another communication from the ESA dated the 19^th^ of May 2004 (no longer available in the ESA's website) acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! The ESA had been warned of its error by Mr. Albert Kisskoy, Pr. Gary Li of the University of the State of California and Dr. Zhimin Man from the Fundan University of Shangai.... After this little uproar it is still unclear for some people whether the myth is true or not. In order to answer this question, it is not necessary to go into Space and look: it suffices to know a little about the human visual system and its limits. Not even the best of human eyes at a simple glace could see the Great Wall of China from Space. The impossibility is due to the limitation of the human eye when it comes to seeing small diffusing objects. The relevant parameter is not the Wall'... s length (about 7300 km), but its width, which is usually less than 6 m. See Figure 1. To illustrate this with a simple example, looking at the Great Wall from a distance of 160 km would be the same as looking at a 2 cm diameter cable from more than half a kilometre away! No matter how good the atmospheric conditions, lighting and contrast are —unless the object was self-illuminated or it reflected the sun as a small mirror— it would be totally impossible to see this cable (or, for similar reasons, the Great Wall) at a simple glance, because the eye would need a visual acuity greater than approximately 20/3, which is 7.7 times the normal visual acuity^1^, and more than three times the maximum acuity reached by a falcon^2^, an eagle^3^, or a human eye^4^. Even an optically perfect human eye^5-7^ would not be able to see the monument for two reasons. First, the sampling due to the finite cone spacing in the central fovea^5-7^ imposes a limit to the visual acuity of 2.3 (about 20/9). In this case, a perfect image of the Great Wall would be about one third the size of a single cone excluding pupil diffraction effects. Second, pupil diffraction effects also limit the human visual acuity to 5 (20/4)^6-8^ (for a 6 mm pupil and a 555 nm wavelength). In other words, the edges of the Wall have a spatial frequency that is about two and a half times higher than the cut-off frequency (189 c/deg) of a perfect human eye with a 6 mm pupil. Nevertheless, according to Westheimer experiments^9^, the minimum angle subtended by a line for it to be seen from the distance is approximately only 2 seconds of arc. Such angle is smaller than the one subtended by the Great Wall when observed from Space. Westherimer... 's results are based on the detection of a black line against a bright background; in this scenario, the black line causes a local dip in the luminance of the image, which makes it possible for the eye to detect it. Such a great local change in luminance also makes the detection of the stars at night possible (if bright enough), as does the reflection of the sun in a small distant mirror (as used in a boat to indicate its position). Therefore, in principle, if the Great Wall reflected the sunlight as a long mirror or it were self-illuminated with high-power lamps it could probably be seen form Space. However, in this hypothetical case, the astronaut would not be seeing the Wall but either the lamps or the sunlight reflection. Moreover, natural sun reflection would be very unlikely due to the type of material it was built with (limestone, clay, granite and brick).\n\nObviously, it would be even less likely to see the Great Wall from the moon, situated at a minimum distance of 350,000 km, because the visual acuity would have to be 17,000 times (!) better than that of the normal human eye (in this case it would amount to seeing the cable from a distance of more than 1000 km). In this sense, if the question was: “Could we see the Great Wall of China at a simple glance from Space?” The answer would also have to be “no”, because an astronaut located on the limit of the atmosphere, about 80 km (50 miles) away, would need a visual acuity of approximately 3.9 (about 20/5) to be able to see it.... As a simple exercise, Google Earth^©^ can be used to see the Wall at lat.=40.48234, lon.=116.180592 if one is close enough to the ground. However, once you are more than 40 miles away, it cannot be seen. This simple experiment does not really answer the question since the visualization of the Wall will depends not only on our vision, but also on the satelite image resolution, our computer screen, etc. Despite this, it can be observed that, at a height of 40 miles, the Wall is not visible but the landing runway of the Yongning Airport, located about 4 miles WNW to the Wall, is. Moreover, if the Great Wall was visible from Space, then, contrary to common claims, it would not be the only visible manmade object since astronauts would also enjoy the view of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and probably their own house in case it is more than 6 m wide and long.\n\nFor some unknown reasons (perhaps marketing-related) this belief is one of the “unscientific walls” that has become popular, imposing a false limit to our vision of the world.... - 1.Oyster C.W.

            "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

            "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).... To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.\n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.... ### Ming Great Wall\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From here, the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There, at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关,\n\n*Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.... *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城,\n\n*Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of\n\n*Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the\n\n*China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

The current English name evolved from accounts of \"the Chinese wall\" from early modern European travelers. By the nineteenth century, \"the Great Wall of China\" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as \"the Chinese wall\".... When China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.... ### Han Great Wall\n\nHan fortifications start from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu (t 馬迷途, s 马迷途, *Mǎmítú*, l \"horses losing their way\") near Yumen Pass.... The sections of the Great Wall around Beijing, were frequently renovated, and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, as it was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China; foreign dignitaries would be shown this section on visits to the Great Wall. The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated. South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 m (25 ft 7 in) high and 5 m (16 ft 5 in) wide.\n\nOne of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling. There it runs 11 km (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 m (16 ft 5 in to 26 ft 3 in) in height, and 6 m (19 ft 8 in) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 m (16 ft 5 in) across the top. Wangjing Lou (t 望京樓, s 望京楼, *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.... At the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城, *Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's Wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of *Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the *China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

            "snippet": "Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space? This intriguing question has fascinated many for years, blending the allure of an ancient wonder with the marvels of space exploration. The Great Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Despite its impressive size, the visibility of the Great Wall from space is a more complex issue than it may seem, involving factors like distance, color, lighting, and the capabilities of human vision and technology.... ## Understanding The Visibility Factors\n\nThe question of whether you can see the Great Wall of China from space encompasses several\n\n**visibility factors**. To grasp this better, it’s essential to break down the elements that influence what astronauts can observe from low Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n### Distance from Earth’s Surface\n\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits approximately 240 miles above Earth, have a limited visibility range. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions can obscure smaller structures. While the Great Wall spans vast distances, distinguishing its segments among the varied landscape can be challenging.\n\n### Color and Contrast\n\nThe\n\n**great wall’s color** also plays a vital role in its visibility from space. Constructed primarily with earth and stone materials that blend well with the surrounding terrain, the wall often camouflages against the landscape. Unlike brighter man-made structures or urban areas, the wall’s earthy tones diminish its prominence in photographs taken from space.... ### Weather and Atmospheric Conditions\n\nWeather conditions can significantly affect visibility. Clear skies are essential for remarkable space views. Clouds, rain, and atmospheric haze can obscure the wall and other ground features. Additionally, light plays a critical role; during sunset or sunrise, shadows can help highlight or obscure the wall’s structure.... ## Astronaut Accounts and Visual Confirmation\n\nThough many astronauts have reported seeing landmarks from space, specific references to the Great Wall are rare. According to various accounts, while some astronauts have claimed glimpses of the Great Wall, they describe it as extremely thin and indistinct, often blending in with the natural landscape.\n\n### Notable Astronaut Quotes\n\n**Chris Hadfield**, a Canadian astronaut, mentioned in interviews and on social media platforms that, while you can see some features of the Great Wall, identifying it without prior knowledge is extremely difficult. **Andrew R. Morgan**, another astronaut, noted that various extensions of the wall are challenging to distinguish from other geographical features.\n\nThese statements reflect a common sentiment among astronauts: while the Great Wall is a remarkable structure on Earth, its visibility from space isn’t what most people might expect.... ## Technological Advancements in Satellite Imaging\n\nAs technology has evolved, so have the capabilities of satellite imaging. Modern satellites can capture high-resolution images of Earth, allowing scientists and researchers to study the Great Wall from beyond the atmosphere.... ### Satellite Imagery and Mapping\n\nSeveral satellites equipped with sophisticated sensors can detect structures on Earth’s surface. These images often highlight changes in land use, urban sprawl, and historical sites like the Great Wall. However, the technical capability to ‘see’ the wall does not equate to simple visibility by the naked eye.\n\n\n\n**Satellite** | **Capabilities** | **Purpose** |... |————————-|———————————————————|——————————————————–|\n| Landsat (NASA) | Medium-resolution images (30m pixels) | Earth observation, environmental observation |\n| WorldView-3 | High-resolution images (31cm pixels) | Urban planning, disaster response |\n| SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) | High-resolution and multispectral images | Agricultural monitoring, forestry management |\nModern satellites, like WorldView-3, possess extremely high-resolution imaging capabilities, allowing researchers to identify natural and artificial structures—including the Great Wall—more clearly. This advancement raises the question of technological versus physical visibility.... ## The Great Wall and Global Awareness\n\nThe Great Wall of China serves as a symbol of cultural pride and historical significance. Its immense scale is part of its charm and enduring fascination.\n\n**Understanding the wall’s impact** on global culture and tourism reveals why seeing it from space, while challenging, is still a significant inquiry.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nConstructed over several dynasties, the\n\n**Great Wall’s purpose** was multifold. Primarily built for defense, it also played a key role in facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors annually. Its preservation and restoration have become vital issues, ensuring this architectural marvel remains part of human heritage.\n\n### Tourism and Global Studies\n\nTourism is a significant aspect of the Great Wall’s legacy. Millions visit every year to walk its lengths and experience its history. From a global perspective, the Great Wall also becomes a subject of study for environmental scientists and historians examining its interactions with modern development and climate change.... ## Conclusion: The Reality of Visibility\n\nthe inquiry of\n\n**Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space?** has nuanced answers. While certain **high-resolution satellite images** can identify aspects of the wall, visually locating it from the **International Space Station** proves to be intricate due to various factors such as distance, color blending, and atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe Great Wall continues to inspire awe and curiosity, serving not only as a monumental structure but also as a rich part of cultural heritage that invites exploration, understanding, and preservation. For those intrigued by the complexities of visibility from space and the wonders of our planet, the Great Wall stands as a testament to human ingenuity, offering further avenues for exploration—be it from above or on foot along its storied paths.\n\nFor further detailed observations and scientific insights on satellite imaging technologies, view more at NASA Satellite Imagery Science and to explore global cultural heritage, visit UNESCO’s Great Wall Page.",

            "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

            "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected.

A popular myth, the claim was disproved when astronauts stated that the Great Wall of China was not visible with the naked eye from the Moon. Due to its coloration and pollution, the structure is only sometimes visible from low orbit and the International Space Station.\n\n#### Related Questions\n- Why was the Great Wall of China built?\n- What are the major ethnic groups in China?",

            "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

Credit: Canva\n\n“The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure that is visible from space.” As kids, this was one of the most popular statements that made us wonder at the sheer size of this wall. And this statement has stuck around for a long time; in fact from before the first man planted his feet on the moon. In 1754, English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"\n\nBut the answer is simple and this persistent myth has been debunked countless times by astronauts and scientists alike, specifically by those who have actually been to space - NO.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n## The Great Wall Is Not Visible From Space To The Naked Eye\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall is visible from space has captured the public imagination for decades. Its sheer length and historical significance contribute to this misconception. However, the vastness of space and the relatively small size of the wall compared to the Earth make it impossible to see without advanced optical equipment.\n\nEven from the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits relatively close to Earth, the Great Wall is barely distinguishable without high-powered cameras and zoom lenses. Astronauts have consistently reported that other man-made structures, such as large cities or highways, are far more visible from orbit.\n\nThe Great Wall, while impressive in scale, is simply too narrow and blends in too much with its surroundings to be seen by the human eye from the perspective of space.... ## Are Any Other Structures Visible From Space?Yes. While the Great Wall of China is not visible from space, plenty of other human-made structures can be seen from orbit. The Pyramids of Giza, for example, are famously visible from the International Space Station, as photographed during Expedition 32. Some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\n**Mallika Bhagat author**\n\nMallika Bhagat dreams about travelling permanently and writing occasionally.

            "snippet": "#### Space Myth\n\nSince 1904, people have been claiming that the Great Wall of China is so big and so prominent, that it can be seen from the surface of the moon. After years of waiting, Apollo astronauts were able to confirm the authenticity of this claim. Their answer: no.\n\nAlan Bean, of the Apollo 12 mission, recounts that all you can really make out on the Earth are lots of white clouds and snow, some blue patches, a little bit of yellow, and, every once in a while, a patch of green.\n\n“No man-made object is visible at this scale.” — Alan Bean, Apollo 12 astronaut.\n\n#### A Closer Look\n\nThe Chinese space program shook upon learning that their astronaut, Yang Liwei, couldn’t see the wall from space. This at least confirmed the invisibility wasn’t a political conspiracy.\n\nAfter numerous missions to space, by astronauts from countries all over the world, nobody could see the wall. The International Space Station, which is 238,601 miles closer to the Earth than the Moon, or only 0.1% as far away, still offers no view of the Wall with the naked eye.\n\n#### Finally Photographed\n\nIt was Chinese-American astronaut Leroy Chiao who would eventually spot the wall using a camera and 180mm lens. Even then, he could only identify a small portion of it. For refference, the human eye can see about 50mm.\n\nChiao took another photograph using a 400mm lens, and experts were even less sure that he had taken a photo of the actual wall. Favorable snowfall and sunlight had seemed to be largely responsible for photographing the wall the first time.\n\nNASA says the Great Wall is hard to photograph, but low-orbit satellites can use radar to capture it.",

            "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it.

            "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

            "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

            "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected.

            "snippet": "# The Great Wall of China is Visible from Space: A Fact-Check\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe claim that \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space\" has persisted for decades, often cited as a testament to the wall's immense scale. This assertion has been popularized in various forms, including the notion that it is the only man-made structure visible from the Moon. However, the validity of this claim has been scrutinized by experts and scientists. This article explores the evidence surrounding this claim and examines the reliability of the sources that discuss it.\n\n## What We Know\n\n\n\n**Visibility from Space**: The consensus among experts is that the Great Wall of China is not easily visible from space with the naked eye. A 2010 article published in *PMC*states that even the best human eyes cannot see the wall from space due to its narrowness and the surrounding landscape 1.\n\n\n\n**Astronaut Accounts**: Astronauts have reported that the wall is difficult to see from low Earth orbit. For instance, Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, stated that he could not see the wall during his mission in 2003 5.\n\n\n\n**NASA's Position**: NASA has produced images of the Great Wall taken from the International Space Station (ISS), but these images require photographic equipment to capture the structure clearly, indicating that it is not visible to the naked eye 2.\n\n\n\n**Myth Origins**: The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon likely originated from a 1932 cartoon published by Ripley's Believe It or Not! 10. This myth has persisted despite a lack of evidence supporting it.\n\n\n\n**Pollution and Coloration**: Factors such as pollution and the wall's coloration make it even less visible from space. According to *Scientific American*, the wall blends into its surroundings, making it challenging to distinguish from the landscape 6.... ## Analysis\n\nThe sources discussing the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space vary in their credibility and potential biases:\n\n\n\n**Scientific and Academic Sources**: Articles from *Scientific American*and *PMC*provide scientifically grounded perspectives. They rely on expert opinions and empirical evidence, making them reliable for understanding the limitations of human vision and the challenges of visibility from space 16.\n\n\n\n**NASA**: As a leading authority in space exploration, NASA's images and statements carry significant weight. Their documentation of the Great Wall, while visually impressive, reinforces the idea that visibility is not feasible without specialized equipment 2.\n\n\n\n**Popular Media**: Sources like *Snopes*and *Britannica*offer fact-checking perspectives that clarify the myth's origins and its perpetuation over time. They emphasize the distinction between popular belief and scientific reality 38.\n\n\n\n**Potential Bias**: Some sources, such as *Times Now News*and *Jagran Josh*, may have a more sensationalist approach, focusing on the myth's cultural significance rather than providing a rigorous scientific analysis 49. This could lead to a skewed representation of the facts.\n\n\n\n**Methodological Concerns**: While many sources cite astronaut accounts and scientific studies, the methodology behind these claims is not always transparent. For example, how visibility was assessed or the specific conditions under which observations were made are often not detailed.... ## Conclusion\n\n**Verdict: False**\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is false. Key evidence supporting this conclusion includes expert consensus indicating that the wall is too narrow and blends into its surroundings, making it nearly impossible to see with the naked eye from space. Astronaut accounts, including those from Yang Liwei, further corroborate this, as they have reported difficulty in spotting the wall even from low Earth orbit. Additionally, NASA's imagery demonstrates that specialized photographic equipment is necessary to capture the wall clearly, reinforcing the assertion that it is not visible without aid.\n\nIt is important to note that while the myth of the Great Wall's visibility has cultural significance and has been popularized over time, it lacks scientific support. The origins of this myth can be traced back to a 1932 cartoon, which highlights how misinformation can persist despite a lack of evidence.\n\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations in the available evidence. Visibility can depend on various factors, including atmospheric conditions and the observer's location. Thus, while the consensus is clear, there may be specific scenarios where visibility could be marginally improved, though this does not substantiate the claim as a general truth.\n\nReaders are encouraged to critically evaluate information and consider the sources and evidence behind claims, especially those that have become entrenched in popular belief.... ## Sources\n\n- López-Gil, N.

                "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

                "snippet": "# Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow\n\nFive months ago, we introduced Flow, our AI filmmaking tool powered by Veo, and have been inspired by the creativity it has sparked with over 275 million videos generated in Flow\n\n1\n\n. We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

                "snippet": "# Meet Flow: AI-powered filmmaking with Veo 3\n\nToday we’re introducing Flow, our new AI filmmaking tool.\n\nIt’s built by and for creatives, and it’s the only AI filmmaking tool custom-designed for Google’s most advanced models — Veo, Imagen and Gemini. Flow can help storytellers explore their ideas without bounds and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. It’s early days, and we’re excited to shape the future of Flow with creatives and filmmakers.\n\n### What’s possible with Flow\n\nFlow is inspired by what it feels like when time slows down and creation is effortless, iterative and full of possibility. It’s custom-designed for Veo, Google’s state-of-the-art generative video model, with exceptional prompt adherence and stunning cinematic outputs that excel at physics and realism. Behind the scenes, Gemini models make prompting intuitive, so you can describe your vision in everyday language. You can bring your own assets to create characters, or use Flow to make your own ingredients with Imagen’s text-to-image capabilities.\n\nOnce you’ve created a subject or a scene, you can integrate those same ingredients into different clips and scenes with consistency. Or you can use a scene image to start a new shot.\n\nCreate your ingredients\n\nUse those ingredients to create a clip\n\nReference ingredients in plain language... ### Key features to unlock your storytelling\n\nFlow also comes with a range of features for professionals or those just getting started:\n\n**Camera Controls:**Master your shot with direct control over camera motion, angles and perspectives. **Scenebuilder:**Seamlessly edit and extend your existing shots — revealing more of the action or transitioning to what happens next with continuous motion and consistent characters. **Asset Management:**Easily manage and organize all of your ingredients and prompts. **Flow TV** **:**Spark your creativity with an ever-growing showcase of clips, channels, and content generated with Veo. You can see the exact prompts and techniques used for clips you like, providing a practical way to learn and adapt new styles.\n\nSeamless transitions\n\nCamera controls\n\nCinematic quality\n\n### Get started with Flow\n\nFlow is the evolution of VideoFX, a Google Labs experiment that launched last year. Starting today, Flow is available to subscribers of our Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra plans in the U.S., with more countries coming soon.\n\nGoogle AI Pro gives you the key Flow features and 100 generations per month, and Google AI Ultra gives you the highest usage limits and early access to Veo 3 with native audio generation, bringing environmental sounds and character dialogue directly into video creation.... ### How we’re collaborating with filmmakers\n\nAs with any groundbreaking technology, we’re still understanding the full potential of AI in filmmaking. We see the emergence of these tools as an enabler, helping a new wave of filmmakers more easily tell their stories. By offering filmmakers early access to Flow, we were able to better understand how our technology could best support and integrate into their creative workflows — and we’ve woven their insights into Flow. Here are some filmmakers we partnered with and the short films they developed using Flow along with other tools and techniques.\n\n**Dave Clark**\n\nDave is an award-winning filmmaker focused on embracing new technology as part of his filmmaking. He used AI to develop two of his most recent short films, “Battalion” and “NinjaPunk.” His newest short film “Freelancers” uses Google’s AI and other tools to tell the story of two estranged adopted brothers on similar quests.\n\n**Henry Daubrez**\n\nHenry has been using tech tools in his art for the last 18 years. Earlier this year he unveiled “Kitsune” using Veo 2 — a moving short film about “love between two souls separated by everything except their shared feelings of loneliness.” Now, Henry is bringing the story of his own creative journey to life in “Electric Pink.”\n\n**Junie Lau**\n\nJunie Lau is a film director and multidisciplinary creative deeply passionate about innovation, viewing AI as a vital collaborator in expanding the boundaries of creative expression. Her work delves into artistic narratives within the hyper-modern era, including themes of virtual identity, digital humanities and digital ontology. Currently, Junie is working on a film titled “Dear Stranger,” which explores the boundless and infinite nature of universal love between a grandmother and grandchild across countless parallel worlds.\n\nAI is ushering in a new chapter of creativity and filmmaking, and while it’s still early, we see so much potential for tools like Flow to unlock new voices and creations.\n\nFor more insights on Flow and how AI helps storytellers take more risks in the creative storytelling process, watch Dave Clark, Junie Lau, and Henry Daubrez in \"Behind the Lens: AI, Creativity, and the Future of Filmmaking Tools.\"",

These new models are available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Veo 3.1 is also available in the Gemini app and Flow.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast empower developers to create more engaging content through significant upgrades. The models now generate\n\n**richer native audio**, from natural conversations to synchronized sound effects, and offer **greater narrative control** with an improved understanding of cinematic styles. **Enhanced image-to-video** capabilities ensure better prompt adherence while delivering superior audio and visual quality and maintaining character consistency across multiple scenes.\n\nIn addition to the model update, we are introducing new model capabilities, including using reference images to guide video generation, extend existing Veo videos, and generate transitions between a first and last frame.\n\nYou can now guide the generation process by providing up to 3 reference images of a character, object, or scene. This is helpful for maintaining character consistency across multiple shots or applying a specific style to your video.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nreference_images=[reference_image1, reference_image2],\n\n),\n\n\n\n```... Your story is no longer limited by the original generation. With Scene extension, you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, by generating new clips that connect to your previous video. Each new video is generated based on the final second of the previous clip. This maintains visual continuity, making the feature ideal for extending shots with background audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nvideo=video_to_extend\n\n\n\n```\n\nCreate smooth, natural scenes that bridge two different images.

We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

We’ll move step by step and flag common gotchas so you can avoid them.\n\n## What is Google Veo 3.1?\n\nGoogle Veo 3.1 is a text-to-video AI model that turns short written prompts and references into short video clips, with native audio support and more control over storytelling and style. In October 2025, Google announced Veo 3.1 (and a faster variant) in paid preview for developers and creators. According to the Google Developers Blog announcement (Oct 15, 2025), Veo 3.1 is available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and it adds richer native audio, improved adherence to cinematic styles, and new creative controls.\n\nWhy it matters for beginners: Veo 3.1’s improvements make it easier to describe the mood and motion you want—like “a slow dolly-in on a vintage typewriter with soft rain ambience”—and actually get something close, without wrestling with advanced settings.... ## What’s new compared to earlier Veo versions?\n\nGoogle calls out a few key upgrades in Veo 3.1:\n\n- Richer native audio generation and better narrative control, with improved understanding of cinematic styles (publisher: Google; see the Developers Blog announcement (2025)).\n\n- New creative tools in supporting apps: you can guide generation with multiple reference images, extend existing Veo clips, or bridge between a first and last frame to create transitions. These capabilities are highlighted in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (Oct 2025).\n\n- Native audio emphasis and model positioning are also described on the DeepMind Veo model page, which introduces Veo’s “video, meet audio” concept.\n\nIndependent coverage, like TechCrunch’s report on the Veo 3.1 release (Oct 2025), provides context on rollout and app integration. For hard limits (length, resolution), always defer to Google’s official docs, as those details can change.\n\n## Where can you use Veo 3.1 today?\n\nAs of October 2025:\n\n- Flow (Google’s AI video editor): Google’s announcement notes Veo 3.1 and advanced creative controls in Flow, including “Ingredients to Video” (use multiple images as style/character references), “Frames to Video” (bridge between start/end frames), and “Extend” (lengthen a clip). Details are outlined in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (2025).\n\n- Gemini API (Google AI Studio and Vertex AI): Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast are in paid preview via the Gemini API, per the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\nImportant: Access tiers, regions, and pricing can vary and may change. If you’re not seeing options in your account, check Google’s documentation or support for your account type and region.... ## What can Veo 3.1 generate right now? (Practical limits to know)\n\n- In Vertex AI’s preview for Veo 3.1 base generations, the documented lengths are currently short (choose 4, 6, or 8 seconds). This is specified on the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview page.\n\n- In Gemini API extension workflows, you can extend Veo-generated clips. The API docs describe a maximum of up to 141 seconds for input Veo videos in those extension scenarios, with 720p listed in that context. See the Gemini API video documentation (Google).\n\nThese numbers help set expectations: start with short shots, then extend or chain shots together. Avoid assuming 1080p or minute-long base generations unless Google’s official docs explicitly state it for your environment.... ## A 10-minute quickstart: your first Veo 3.1 clip\n\nWe’ll make a simple “coffee shop mood” shot you can adapt for social posts.\n\n- Choose your aspect ratio\n\n- 16:9 (landscape) for YouTube and desktop-first screens\n\n- 9:16 (vertical) for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts Pick one at the start to avoid accidental cropping later.\n\n- Write a clear, concrete prompt Use this structure to get reliable results: subject + action + setting + style + camera + audio.\n\n- Example prompt: “A barista gently places a ceramic cup on a wooden counter; shallow depth of field; warm morning light streaming through windows; slow dolly-in; subtle steam rising; soft cafe ambience, no dialogue, light jazz in the background.”\n\nIf you want a deeper primer on prompt structure and clarity, see these prompt engineering best practices for beginners.\n\n- Generate in your chosen interface\n\n- In Flow: Start a new project, choose Veo 3.1, paste your prompt, set aspect ratio, and generate.\n\n- In Gemini API/Vertex AI: Use the model/version and parameters documented for Veo 3.1 in your environment. Begin with short durations and default settings.\n\n- Review the output like a director\n\n- Does the subject and action match? Is the lighting/mood close?\n\n- Is the camera movement smooth? Is audio what you expected?\n\n- Make one or two changes per iteration—small edits beat big rewrites.\n\n- Refine with controls\n\n- Reference images: If you want consistency (e.g., the same mug or barista style), use up to three reference images to guide the look. This capability is described in Google’s announcements (2025).\n\n- Frames to Video: Provide a starting and ending frame to shape the motion between them.\n\n- Extend: Lengthen your favorite moment to create a longer beat.\n\n- Export Choose the format/aspect ratio you started with. If you need both vertical and horizontal versions, plan to reframe or regenerate with the other aspect ratio rather than cropping aggressively.... ## A practical planning example using Skywork AI (optional, 5 minutes)\n\nSkywork AI can help you prepare the words before you ever hit “Generate.” Disclosure: Skywork AI is our product.\n\nHere’s a neutral, step-by-step way to use it purely for planning:\n\n- Open Skywork and create a new document. Ask for a short video outline: “30-second coffee shop mood piece: 3 shots, warm tone, slow camera.”\n\n- Have it draft a compact shot list with camera moves and audio notes, like:\n\n- Close-up of cup; slow dolly-in; soft steam; light jazz; no dialogue\n\n- Medium barista hands; gentle rack focus; cafe ambience; espresso hiss\n\n- Wide room tone; sunbeams; slow tilt up; footsteps and cups\n\n- Ask for a final prompt assembled from the shot you want to generate first. Copy that prompt into Veo 3.1.\n\nIf you prefer to outline prompts and story beats yourself, this short guide to Skywork’s General Mode for planning and outlining walks through a simple, distraction-free workflow.... ## FAQs for first-time users\n\n\n\nIs Veo 3.1 free? No. Google describes Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast as being in paid preview via the Gemini API as of October 2025. See the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025). Pricing varies by product and usage.\n\n\n\nWhere can I try Veo 3.1? Flow (for a visual editor), and the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI (for developers). Google outlines these options in the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025) and the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nHow long can my video be? It depends on the environment and workflow. In Vertex AI’s Veo 3.1 preview, base generations are short (4, 6, or 8 seconds). In Gemini API extension workflows, input Veo videos can be extended up to 141 seconds. See the Vertex AI preview page and the Gemini API video docs.\n\n\n\nWhat resolutions are supported? The Gemini API documentation for extension workflows references 720p in that context. Official materials do not universally guarantee 1080p for base Veo 3.1 generations at this time.\n\n\n\nCan I keep a character or object consistent across shots? Yes. Google notes you can guide Veo 3.1 with up to three reference images for a character, object, or scene. This is described in the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nCan I add my own audio and sync it? Veo 3.1 focuses on native audio generation controlled via your prompt. The public pages cited here do not detail a full “upload and auto-sync” workflow, so avoid relying on that unless you see it documented for your account.... ## Next steps\n\n- Try a tiny project: one 6–8 second shot with a clear prompt. If you like the result, use “Extend” or stitch a second shot with “Frames to Video.”\n\n- Build a simple storyboard first. If you want help outlining ideas, you can use Skywork AI to draft prompts and shot lists before you generate. Keep it simple: one scene, one action, one camera move.\n\n- When you’re ready to go deeper, explore Google’s official resources: the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025), the Developers Blog announcement (2025), the DeepMind Veo overview, the Gemini API video docs, and the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview.\n\nYou don’t need special “artistic talent” to start—just one clear sentence and a little patience. Generate, review, tweak, repeat. That’s how everyone learns, and you’ll be surprised how quickly it clicks.",

We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

                "snippet": "## Murray Frost\n##### Jul 09, 2025 (0:04:15)\n✅ Build a Monetized YouTube Channel in 90 days: https://murrayfrost.com/YT-Accelerator\n\nI teach people YouTube from REAL data from over 150 clients and my own channels. Data-driven feedback and strategies. None of this guessing garbage people put on online teaching you how to do YouTube.... {ts:0} So, Google Labs just had an update and it's technically called Flow. It's on\n{ts:4} their labs.google platform and you can see by the beginning of this video that it does still need some work, but you\n{ts:9} haven't been able to do that recently with Google Labs. And now you can do it with Google's Vo3. So, there's been a\n{ts:15} couple updates here that you can see. And the first one here is using images or allowing images to talk with Google's\n{ts:20} VO3, which again still needs some work, but look, it gets maybe 60% of the way there. I think it looks pretty decent.\n{ts:29} I'm obviously not going to use it to try and convince people that it's real, but maybe you can get kind of creative with\n{ts:34} this and get people to make some really funny, strange, or just dumb things that people love. I don't know why people\n{ts:42} just love brain rot these days. Now, they're also adding the option to do this with V V3 on frames to video, which\n{ts:49} is actually kind of cool. And they... 're also allowing you to top up your subscription with the kind of a mid tier\n{ts:56} option cuz previously they had just the the starter which was about 20 bucks or so per month in the US and then it was\n{ts:63} straight up to I think 250 without the discount for the first 3 months and there's just no in between. It's just a\n{ts:70} massive jump. So they added like a kind of a mid tier there. I think a couple too. Well, I'll show you what that looks\n{ts:75} like and you can top up your credits there as well. They've also gone ahead and just added better audio coverage,\n{ts:83} which I haven't really noticed all that much to be honest. Right now, there's not a huge difference as at least a\n{ts:89} noticeable difference in my opinion from me using it. Um, they also do remove audio when miners are involved. Keep\n{ts:96} that in mind. That's why your audio isn't being generated if you have kids in the video or maybe uh even teenagers\n{ts:101} sometimes. Um, but then there's also they've mentioned they're reducing um unwanted subtitles, which is actually... {ts:107} quite nice. They've been removing the the VEO watermark as well, but now they said they've reduced the unwanted\n{ts:114} subtitles. I still get them sometimes. So, I literally in caps specify in the prompt to not include captions because\n{ts:121} otherwise if I don't, sometimes the captions still show up. And the really nice quality of life update they've made\n{ts:127} here is that when you are just starting a new project or revisiting an existing one, it doesn't reset the model that you\n{ts:135} have, or at least if it does, it resets to the VO3 fast beta audio. So, this is where you're generating audio. So now\n{ts:142} you don't accidentally have VO2 selected with no audio every time you either reload a page, start a new project, or\n{ts:150} you leave and come back and it's been reset to just its default VO2. Now it's actually its default is V3 fast beta\n{ts:157} audio. So the 20 credits per generation, the cheaper VO3 option with audio. So now you don't accidentally generate\n{ts:164} videos without audio, which has happened a lot to me and I... 've wasted thousands of credits doing that by accident. So,\n{ts:171} great update right there. Quality of life, which you don't have to waste any more credits. Now, now let's say that\n{ts:176} you don't want to spend the $124 per month, and this is for the first 3 months. Then, it goes to 150, I believe,\n{ts:183} per month. So, I'm probably going to cancel it at that point because that's just really expensive, at least using\n{ts:189} VO3. Now you have the option if you have the uh let's see which was it the pro subscription the $20 a month\n{ts:195} subscription right here Google AI pro you still get a th000 credits per month in uh Google labs but you also have the\n{ts:204} option to top up your credits so for example in here when you're creating your AI videos if you run out of credits\n{ts:211} like here you can just hit get more AI credits and you can choose how much you want to add so you don't have to spend\n{ts:216} $200 or $150 at a time you could spend an extra for 24 bucks that month just to top up your credits. This wasn... 't\n{ts:223} available in the lower plans. It was only available in the the maximum ultra tier. So, I really like the ability to\n{ts:230} do that now. So, you don't have to spend so much all at once, especially if you're not using all your credits at the\n{ts:235} end of each month, but maybe one month you're just out and you need to add more, you can do so and add some\n{ts:240} credits, which is actually quite nice. I've hit this button a little too much recently, but uh hey, I'm getting good\n{ts:247} results. So, those are all the current updates with Google's Veo3 with their labs platform. Hope to see you in the\n{ts:253} next one.",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear!

The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

Let me share a secret with you.\n{ts:5} I am your new girlfriend. Google just surprised everyone. VO 3.1 is officially live today. It's faster,\n{ts:22} smarter, and now generates full cinematic clips with sound. And yeah, I've already got access. Let me show you\n{ts:30} how crazy this is. So, here's the thing. VO3.1 isn't available everywhere just yet. Right now, it's rolling out only\n{ts:39} inside Google Flow. So, if you already have a Google AI account, you can access it right from there. I'm already logged\n{ts:46} in and as you can see, the VO3.1 fast model is live. So, yeah, no fake claims here. This is real and I've been talking\n{ts:55} about this since my earlier videos. Now using it is simple. Write your prompt. Select VO3.1 fast. Hit generate. That's\n{ts:65} it. No complex settings, no extra steps. All right, let's talk about what's actually\n{ts:79} new in VO3.1. This update isn't a total overhaul. It... 's more like a smarter, cleaner upgrade to\n{ts:87} V3. Here's what's changed. One, smarter scene creation. You can now combine reference images, locations, characters,\n{ts:96} and objects, and VO automatically builds a cohesive scene around them. No more weird lighting mismatches or random jump\n{ts:104} cuts. Two, built-in sound generation. Every clip now includes matching audio, ambient sounds, dialogue, or effects\n{ts:113} that sync perfectly with the visuals. It makes your videos feel far more cinematic and alive. Three, clip\n{ts:121} extension. You can take a short clip and expand it into a full cinematic sequence. VO keeps the same lighting,\n{ts:129} motion, and audio flow seamlessly. It's perfect for trailers, ads, or storydriven projects. Four, custom start\n{ts:138} and end control. Now you can choose where a shot begins and ends, and VO fills in the middle with smooth,\n{ts:145} realistic transitions that gives you more storytelling control. Five, add or remove elements. Want to remove an\n{ts:153} object or drop in a new one? Just select it. VO automatically adjusts lighting, shadows, and scale to keep everything... {ts:161} realistic. Six, higher realism and physics accuracy. Scenes now behave like real life. Lighting looks natural,\n{ts:170} character movement feels grounded, and the visuals have that cinematic finish. You'll also notice image to video\n{ts:176} generation looks a lot cleaner now. Frames are stable, colors look balanced, and it feels much closer to real\n{ts:183} footage. That said, it still can't generate long videos yet. The maximum I've seen is around 8 seconds. So don't\n{ts:191} expect 1 minute clips for now. So yeah, not a massive reinvention, but a much smarter, smoother version of what VO\n{ts:198} already did well. I'll be testing this more and posting sideby-side comparisons soon. Stay tuned to see how it compares\n{ts:205} to VO3. If this video helped you, hit like, share it with your tech buddies, and make sure you subscribe for more AI\n{ts:212} updates like this.

                "snippet": "# Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow\n\nFive months ago, we introduced Flow, our AI filmmaking tool powered by Veo, and have been inspired by the creativity it has sparked with over 275 million videos generated in Flow\n\n1\n\n. We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

These new models are available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Veo 3.1 is also available in the Gemini app and Flow.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast empower developers to create more engaging content through significant upgrades. The models now generate\n\n**richer native audio**, from natural conversations to synchronized sound effects, and offer **greater narrative control** with an improved understanding of cinematic styles. **Enhanced image-to-video** capabilities ensure better prompt adherence while delivering superior audio and visual quality and maintaining character consistency across multiple scenes.\n\nIn addition to the model update, we are introducing new model capabilities, including using reference images to guide video generation, extend existing Veo videos, and generate transitions between a first and last frame.\n\nYou can now guide the generation process by providing up to 3 reference images of a character, object, or scene. This is helpful for maintaining character consistency across multiple shots or applying a specific style to your video.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nreference_images=[reference_image1, reference_image2],\n\n),\n\n\n\n```... Your story is no longer limited by the original generation. With Scene extension, you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, by generating new clips that connect to your previous video. Each new video is generated based on the final second of the previous clip. This maintains visual continuity, making the feature ideal for extending shots with background audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nvideo=video_to_extend\n\n\n\n```\n\nCreate smooth, natural scenes that bridge two different images. By providing a starting and an ending image, you can direct Veo 3.1 to generate the transition between them, complete with accompanying audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nimage=first_frame,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nlast_frame=last_frame,\n\n),\n\n\n\n```\n\n**What people are building with Veo 3.1**\n\nPromise Studios, a GenAI movie studio, uses Veo 3.1 within its MUSE Platform to enhance generative storyboarding and previsualization for director-driven storytelling at production quality.... Latitude is experimenting with Veo 3.1 in its generative narrative engine to instantly bring user-created stories to life.\n\nVeo 3.1 and these new capabilities are now available in paid preview via the Gemini API.\n\nVeo 3.1 is the same price as Veo 3. We are incredibly excited to see what you will build with these new capabilities!",

                "snippet": "Google has released a new update to its Veo AI video generation model that should make it do a better job of sticking to prompts and converting images into videos. Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

Do you know who is AI master?\n{ts:5} Make Death Star great again. Okay. Oh, today I'm pulling back the curtain on\n{ts:10} Google's new VO3, the next gen AI video model that's got me acting like a kid in a tech toy store. We're talking text to\n{ts:18} video. You type a description and VO3 spits out an 8second video clip with sound. Yes, audio and video from just\n{ts:26} your words. [Music] In this tutorial, I'll show you how to\n{ts:31} harness VO3 to create funny viral style videos like this. It's just a few toasters, right? What's\n{ts:38} the worst that could happen? The big deal here is native audio. Unlike earlier models, VO3 doesn't just\n{ts:46} create silent clips. It also produces sound effects, background noise, even character dialogue to match. Each clip\n{ts:52} is limited to about 8 seconds for now, so we're talking short form content. They left behind a a ball today. It\n{ts:60} bounced higher than I can jump. What manner of magic is that? Now, Google gives us two main ways to... {ts:67} use V3. Flow and Gemini. Think of them as two different cameras that use the same film. Google Flow is like a pro\n{ts:75} filmmaking tool built around V3. It's a dedicated interface currently on Google apps where you can storyboard scenes,\n{ts:82} manage assets, tweak camera moves, the works. Flow was literally customd designed for VO. Lets you do fancy\n{ts:89} things. Upload or generate ingredients like character images via image genen and reuse them in multiple shots for\n{ts:96} consistency. Control camera angles and motion paths manually and even uses scene builder to extend the clips\n{ts:102} seamlessly into the next part of the story. It's basically an AI video studio for filmmakers. Now, Flow isn't open to\n{ts:109} everyone by default. It's available if you have a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription in certain regions. Pro\n{ts:116} subscribers get most flow features, but only the ultra tier unlocks V3 fully. If you are on Pro, you have something\n{ts:123} called VO3 fast speed optimized version with sound slightly lower quality. I'll talk about that in a sec.\n{ts:132} All right, this idea cracks me up. A grandma skydiving into the Super Bowl. Talk about a stun granny. Let... {ts:276} I always try to include. Subject, who or what is in the scene, action, what the subject is doing. Context, setting,\n{ts:284} where and when is this happening. Motion, camera and movement, how the scene is shot and moves. Style, the\n{ts:291} visual style or genre. framing, composition, how the shot is framed, and constraints, extras, any additional\n{ts:298} details or instructions. And don't forget audio. VO3 will generate sound to match your scene, but only if you tell\n{ts:305} it what you want to hear. So, I often append an audio double colon section in the prompt describing sound effects,\n{ts:312} background noise, or dialogue lines. For example, audio double colon crowd cheering, upbeat rock music playing\n{ts:319} faintly, or character says hello world. You can specify dialogue explicitly, word for word, or implicitly, like a man\n{ts:327} introduces himself and let the AI make up the words. If you ask for dialogue, add no subtitles to your prompt.\n{ts:334} Otherwise, the model might plaster autogenerated subtitles on the video, which look well, not great. We... 'll see\n{ts:340} that in action soon. A boring prompt like a man answers a phone might yield a bland clip. But a richly detailed prompt\n{ts:348} can produce something cinematic. For instance, check this out. Basic prompt. A man answers a rotary phone.\n{ts:356} Hello. And detailed prompt. A shaky dolly zoom goes from a faraway\n{ts:364} blur to a close-up cinematic shot of a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he picks up a rotary\n{ts:370} phone mounted on a gritty brick wall. Bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign. The zoom reveals the tension on\n{ts:377} his face as he struggles to speak. shallow depth of field keeps focus on his furrowed brow and the phone, while\n{ts:384} the background is a blur of neon colors and shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation.\n{ts:392} I I have to Which one would you rather watch? The\n{ts:400} second prompt, nail subject, action, context, motion, that dolly zoom, style, cinematic, neon, noir, vibes, framing,\n{ts:408} close-up, ambience, eerie, neon, glow, all the elements. VO3 will follow the detailed prompt much more faithfully... {ts:416} than a vague one, yielding a dramatic video instead of a random guy on a phone. Bottom line, be specific and\n{ts:423} vivid. Describe what the camera sees and what the mic hears. Now, coming up with such detailed prompt can feel like\n{ts:429} flexing a new muscle. Here's where I cheat a little. I use Chad GBT to help refine prompt. Sometimes I'll start with\n{ts:436} a simple idea, say grandma's skydiving into stadium, and ask Chad GBT to describe the scene in a funny cinematic\n{ts:445} way with sights and sounds. The AI will usually output a nicely embellished description that I can copy or tweak for\n{ts:452} VO. Similarly, I use Smidjourney for visual prototyping. I'll feed a quick version of my idea to Midjourney to get\n{ts:459} a still image that helps me visualize the color palette or style I want. Maybe I like how it looks as a 1980s cartoon\n{ts:467} versus a gritty realistic photo and I can then describe that style in my VO prompt. This extra step isn't required,\n{ts:476} but if you... {ts:509} cheering. stadium announcer muffled wind rushing and the grandma's voice yelling yahoo in excitement no subtitles\n{ts:517} and that covers subject grandma action skydiving context super stadium motion wide follow shot slow-mo style cinematic\n{ts:527} bright realistic and audio crowd wind voice all in one prompt paragraph it's lengthy but should guide V3 perfectly a\n{ts:536} moment of truth let's generate this and see What happens? Yahoo!\n{ts:545} [Applause] Wow, look at that. She's really skydiving into the stadium. The video\n{ts:554} shows this tiny parachute coming down over a huge football field just like we asked. There's a wide shot of the\n{ts:561} stadium with fans standing up. I can see the crowd detail and yes, I hear the cheering roar. The grandma is visible\n{ts:567} hanging from the parachute. Maybe not super close on her face because we chose a wide shot, but enough to tell she's an\n{ts:574} elderly lady in gear. B3 as well as other generators are undoubtedly great, but they all can do\n{ts:582} one thing. Generate complete visual project. Sure, they can do few pictures and a few seconds of video, but what... 't resist add an explosion or two like a car blowing up\n{ts:998} behind them. Audio obviously loud audio double colin roaring T-Rex cowboy whooping car tires screeching an\n{ts:1008} explosion sound and dramatic action music. I will format it as one prompt and run it through Gemini. And here it\n{ts:1016} comes. We've got a T-Rex barreling down what looks like Time Square. A cowboy on his\n{ts:1029} back waving his head.

                "snippet": "# Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow\n\nFive months ago, we introduced Flow, our AI filmmaking tool powered by Veo, and have been inspired by the creativity it has sparked with over 275 million videos generated in Flow\n\n1\n\n. We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

                "snippet": "# Meet Flow: AI-powered filmmaking with Veo 3\n\nToday we’re introducing Flow, our new AI filmmaking tool.\n\nIt’s built by and for creatives, and it’s the only AI filmmaking tool custom-designed for Google’s most advanced models — Veo, Imagen and Gemini. Flow can help storytellers explore their ideas without bounds and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. It’s early days, and we’re excited to shape the future of Flow with creatives and filmmakers.\n\n### What’s possible with Flow\n\nFlow is inspired by what it feels like when time slows down and creation is effortless, iterative and full of possibility. It’s custom-designed for Veo, Google’s state-of-the-art generative video model, with exceptional prompt adherence and stunning cinematic outputs that excel at physics and realism. Behind the scenes, Gemini models make prompting intuitive, so you can describe your vision in everyday language. You can bring your own assets to create characters, or use Flow to make your own ingredients with Imagen’s text-to-image capabilities.\n\nOnce you’ve created a subject or a scene, you can integrate those same ingredients into different clips and scenes with consistency. Or you can use a scene image to start a new shot.\n\nCreate your ingredients\n\nUse those ingredients to create a clip\n\nReference ingredients in plain language... ### Key features to unlock your storytelling\n\nFlow also comes with a range of features for professionals or those just getting started:\n\n**Camera Controls:**Master your shot with direct control over camera motion, angles and perspectives. **Scenebuilder:**Seamlessly edit and extend your existing shots — revealing more of the action or transitioning to what happens next with continuous motion and consistent characters. **Asset Management:**Easily manage and organize all of your ingredients and prompts. **Flow TV** **:**Spark your creativity with an ever-growing showcase of clips, channels, and content generated with Veo. You can see the exact prompts and techniques used for clips you like, providing a practical way to learn and adapt new styles.\n\nSeamless transitions\n\nCamera controls\n\nCinematic quality\n\n### Get started with Flow\n\nFlow is the evolution of VideoFX, a Google Labs experiment that launched last year. Starting today, Flow is available to subscribers of our Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra plans in the U.S., with more countries coming soon.\n\nGoogle AI Pro gives you the key Flow features and 100 generations per month, and Google AI Ultra gives you the highest usage limits and early access to Veo 3 with native audio generation, bringing environmental sounds and character dialogue directly into video creation.... ### How we’re collaborating with filmmakers\n\nAs with any groundbreaking technology, we’re still understanding the full potential of AI in filmmaking. We see the emergence of these tools as an enabler, helping a new wave of filmmakers more easily tell their stories. By offering filmmakers early access to Flow, we were able to better understand how our technology could best support and integrate into their creative workflows — and we’ve woven their insights into Flow. Here are some filmmakers we partnered with and the short films they developed using Flow along with other tools and techniques.\n\n**Dave Clark**\n\nDave is an award-winning filmmaker focused on embracing new technology as part of his filmmaking. He used AI to develop two of his most recent short films, “Battalion” and “NinjaPunk.” His newest short film “Freelancers” uses Google’s AI and other tools to tell the story of two estranged adopted brothers on similar quests.\n\n**Henry Daubrez**\n\nHenry has been using tech tools in his art for the last 18 years. Earlier this year he unveiled “Kitsune” using Veo 2 — a moving short film about “love between two souls separated by everything except their shared feelings of loneliness.” Now, Henry is bringing the story of his own creative journey to life in “Electric Pink.”\n\n**Junie Lau**\n\nJunie Lau is a film director and multidisciplinary creative deeply passionate about innovation, viewing AI as a vital collaborator in expanding the boundaries of creative expression. Her work delves into artistic narratives within the hyper-modern era, including themes of virtual identity, digital humanities and digital ontology. Currently, Junie is working on a film titled “Dear Stranger,” which explores the boundless and infinite nature of universal love between a grandmother and grandchild across countless parallel worlds.\n\nAI is ushering in a new chapter of creativity and filmmaking, and while it’s still early, we see so much potential for tools like Flow to unlock new voices and creations.\n\nFor more insights on Flow and how AI helps storytellers take more risks in the creative storytelling process, watch Dave Clark, Junie Lau, and Henry Daubrez in \"Behind the Lens: AI, Creativity, and the Future of Filmmaking Tools.\"",

We’re taking a deeper look at what you can expect when you try them out yourself.\n\nWe’ve partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of their most powerful video generation model, Veo 3, to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast is designed to work seamlessly in YouTube Shorts for millions of creators and users, for free. It generates outputs with lower latency at 480p so you can easily create video clips – and for the first time, with sound – from any idea, all from your phone.\n\nTap the create button, then the sparkle icon in the top right corner to find our latest gen AI creation tools including Veo 3.\n\nIt’s rolling out now in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with plans to expand to more of you soon.\n\nWe're also introducing new Veo capabilities on Shorts that put your imagination in the spotlight. Soon, you’ll be able to:... We’ll start to experiment with all of these new capabilities in the coming months on Shorts.\n\nStarting a video from a blank timeline can be daunting. That’s why we’re introducing Edit with AI, a new feature that takes the initial heavy lifting off your shoulders. It transforms your raw camera roll footage into a compelling first draft, intelligently finding and arranging your best moments, adding music, transitions, and even a playful voiceover that can react to what’s happening in the video, in either English or Hindi. This gives you a solid starting point so you can jump straight to the fun part: personalizing your video and bringing your unique vision to life.\n\nWe’re experimenting now with Edit with AI on Shorts and in the YouTube Create app, and will expand the feature in the coming weeks in select markets.\n\nAs the world's largest creative playground, YouTube is where trends are born and where you can draw inspiration from. Imagine hearing a line of dialogue that sparks an idea—a funny phrase, a memorable quote, or a one-of-a-kind sound—and you want to remix it into a new sound. With our new Speech to Song remixing tool, you'll be able to do just that, quickly turning the dialogue from eligible videos into catchy soundtracks for your next Short.\n\nCheck it out for yourself. Listen to the original video, and how Speech to song helped transform it using Lyria 2, Google DeepMind's most advanced AI music model.... Now your GRWM videos take on a whole new level of fun!\n\nBehind the scenes, this uses the dialogue from the original video with Lyria 2 to help create the song. And you're able to add your own vibe for the song, like, chill, danceable, or fun. The final result attributes the original creator.\n\nAs always and across these features, we use SynthID watermarks and content labels to indicate that these creations were generated with AI.\n\nWe hope these features foster a new era of playful experimentation on YouTube!",

We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

                "snippet": "If you’ve seen short, cinematic clips made “from a prompt” and wondered how it works, you’re in the right place. This guide will walk you through Google’s latest video generation model, Veo 3.1, in plain English—what it is, why it matters, where you can try it, and a simple first project you can finish in about 10 minutes. Don’t worry if you’ve never touched AI video before. We’ll move step by step and flag common gotchas so you can avoid them.\n\n## What is Google Veo 3.1?\n\nGoogle Veo 3.1 is a text-to-video AI model that turns short written prompts and references into short video clips, with native audio support and more control over storytelling and style. In October 2025, Google announced Veo 3.1 (and a faster variant) in paid preview for developers and creators. According to the Google Developers Blog announcement (Oct 15, 2025), Veo 3.1 is available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and it adds richer native audio, improved adherence to cinematic styles, and new creative controls.\n\nWhy it matters for beginners: Veo 3.1’s improvements make it easier to describe the mood and motion you want—like “a slow dolly-in on a vintage typewriter with soft rain ambience”—and actually get something close, without wrestling with advanced settings.... ## What’s new compared to earlier Veo versions?\n\nGoogle calls out a few key upgrades in Veo 3.1:\n\n- Richer native audio generation and better narrative control, with improved understanding of cinematic styles (publisher: Google; see the Developers Blog announcement (2025)).\n\n- New creative tools in supporting apps: you can guide generation with multiple reference images, extend existing Veo clips, or bridge between a first and last frame to create transitions. These capabilities are highlighted in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (Oct 2025).\n\n- Native audio emphasis and model positioning are also described on the DeepMind Veo model page, which introduces Veo’s “video, meet audio” concept.\n\nIndependent coverage, like TechCrunch’s report on the Veo 3.1 release (Oct 2025), provides context on rollout and app integration. For hard limits (length, resolution), always defer to Google’s official docs, as those details can change.\n\n## Where can you use Veo 3.1 today?\n\nAs of October 2025:\n\n- Flow (Google’s AI video editor): Google’s announcement notes Veo 3.1 and advanced creative controls in Flow, including “Ingredients to Video” (use multiple images as style/character references), “Frames to Video” (bridge between start/end frames), and “Extend” (lengthen a clip). Details are outlined in the Google Blog on Veo 3.1 and Flow (2025).\n\n- Gemini API (Google AI Studio and Vertex AI): Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast are in paid preview via the Gemini API, per the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\nImportant: Access tiers, regions, and pricing can vary and may change. If you’re not seeing options in your account, check Google’s documentation or support for your account type and region.... ## What can Veo 3.1 generate right now? (Practical limits to know)\n\n- In Vertex AI’s preview for Veo 3.1 base generations, the documented lengths are currently short (choose 4, 6, or 8 seconds). This is specified on the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview page.\n\n- In Gemini API extension workflows, you can extend Veo-generated clips. The API docs describe a maximum of up to 141 seconds for input Veo videos in those extension scenarios, with 720p listed in that context. See the Gemini API video documentation (Google).\n\nThese numbers help set expectations: start with short shots, then extend or chain shots together. Avoid assuming 1080p or minute-long base generations unless Google’s official docs explicitly state it for your environment.... ## A 10-minute quickstart: your first Veo 3.1 clip\n\nWe’ll make a simple “coffee shop mood” shot you can adapt for social posts.\n\n- Choose your aspect ratio\n\n- 16:9 (landscape) for YouTube and desktop-first screens\n\n- 9:16 (vertical) for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts Pick one at the start to avoid accidental cropping later.\n\n- Write a clear, concrete prompt Use this structure to get reliable results: subject + action + setting + style + camera + audio.\n\n- Example prompt: “A barista gently places a ceramic cup on a wooden counter; shallow depth of field; warm morning light streaming through windows; slow dolly-in; subtle steam rising; soft cafe ambience, no dialogue, light jazz in the background.”\n\nIf you want a deeper primer on prompt structure and clarity, see these prompt engineering best practices for beginners.\n\n- Generate in your chosen interface\n\n- In Flow: Start a new project, choose Veo 3.1, paste your prompt, set aspect ratio, and generate.\n\n- In Gemini API/Vertex AI: Use the model/version and parameters documented for Veo 3.1 in your environment. Begin with short durations and default settings.\n\n- Review the output like a director\n\n- Does the subject and action match? Is the lighting/mood close?\n\n- Is the camera movement smooth? Is audio what you expected?\n\n- Make one or two changes per iteration—small edits beat big rewrites.\n\n- Refine with controls\n\n- Reference images: If you want consistency (e.g., the same mug or barista style), use up to three reference images to guide the look. This capability is described in Google’s announcements (2025).\n\n- Frames to Video: Provide a starting and ending frame to shape the motion between them.\n\n- Extend: Lengthen your favorite moment to create a longer beat.\n\n- Export Choose the format/aspect ratio you started with. If you need both vertical and horizontal versions, plan to reframe or regenerate with the other aspect ratio rather than cropping aggressively.... ## A practical planning example using Skywork AI (optional, 5 minutes)\n\nSkywork AI can help you prepare the words before you ever hit “Generate.” Disclosure: Skywork AI is our product.\n\nHere’s a neutral, step-by-step way to use it purely for planning:\n\n- Open Skywork and create a new document. Ask for a short video outline: “30-second coffee shop mood piece: 3 shots, warm tone, slow camera.”\n\n- Have it draft a compact shot list with camera moves and audio notes, like:\n\n- Close-up of cup; slow dolly-in; soft steam; light jazz; no dialogue\n\n- Medium barista hands; gentle rack focus; cafe ambience; espresso hiss\n\n- Wide room tone; sunbeams; slow tilt up; footsteps and cups\n\n- Ask for a final prompt assembled from the shot you want to generate first. Copy that prompt into Veo 3.1.\n\nIf you prefer to outline prompts and story beats yourself, this short guide to Skywork’s General Mode for planning and outlining walks through a simple, distraction-free workflow.... ## FAQs for first-time users\n\n\n\nIs Veo 3.1 free? No. Google describes Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast as being in paid preview via the Gemini API as of October 2025. See the Google Developers Blog announcement (2025). Pricing varies by product and usage.\n\n\n\nWhere can I try Veo 3.1? Flow (for a visual editor), and the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI (for developers). Google outlines these options in the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025) and the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nHow long can my video be? It depends on the environment and workflow. In Vertex AI’s Veo 3.1 preview, base generations are short (4, 6, or 8 seconds). In Gemini API extension workflows, input Veo videos can be extended up to 141 seconds. See the Vertex AI preview page and the Gemini API video docs.\n\n\n\nWhat resolutions are supported? The Gemini API documentation for extension workflows references 720p in that context. Official materials do not universally guarantee 1080p for base Veo 3.1 generations at this time.\n\n\n\nCan I keep a character or object consistent across shots? Yes. Google notes you can guide Veo 3.1 with up to three reference images for a character, object, or scene. This is described in the Developers Blog announcement (2025).\n\n\n\nCan I add my own audio and sync it? Veo 3.1 focuses on native audio generation controlled via your prompt. The public pages cited here do not detail a full “upload and auto-sync” workflow, so avoid relying on that unless you see it documented for your account.... ## Next steps\n\n- Try a tiny project: one 6–8 second shot with a clear prompt. If you like the result, use “Extend” or stitch a second shot with “Frames to Video.”\n\n- Build a simple storyboard first. If you want help outlining ideas, you can use Skywork AI to draft prompts and shot lists before you generate. Keep it simple: one scene, one action, one camera move.\n\n- When you’re ready to go deeper, explore Google’s official resources: the Veo 3.1 and Flow post (2025), the Developers Blog announcement (2025), the DeepMind Veo overview, the Gemini API video docs, and the Vertex AI Veo 3.1 preview.\n\nYou don’t need special “artistic talent” to start—just one clear sentence and a little patience. Generate, review, tweak, repeat. That’s how everyone learns, and you’ll be surprised how quickly it clicks.",

                "snippet": "Google has released a new update to its Veo AI video generation model that should make it do a better job of sticking to prompts and converting images into videos. Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

And then here's\n{ts:90} the second generation, the second version that V3 created. Okay. Low key. Can you believe we aren't real? I don't\n{ts:96} know about you, honey. I'm 100% real. Yeah. Yeah. Bet. We're as real as they come. All right. So, in this next one, I\n{ts:103} tried to get two trains heading towards each other. They smash into each other. Huge explosion. And for some reason, I\n{ts:110} just could not get it to work. But let me show you what did generate. So, here was my first attempt. Two massive trains... {ts:255} second one, the hand looks better. That's weird. And it kind of just changes\n{ts:263} frames for a second. But uh yeah, either way, that is not what's in a Rubik's cube. Look at this. It actually looks\n{ts:269} really cool. Look at all of these detailed gears inside the Rubik's Cube. All right, but of course you are all\n{ts:275} familiar with this meme. And what if you get V3 to make a video out of it? Are you serious right now? I can't\n{ts:284} believe you. You are unbelievable. Do you have an idea that you've been putting off for a\n{ts:290} while because you don't have the technical knowledge to turn it into reality? With Hostinger Horizons, this\n{ts:296} is now possible. Hostinger just launched Hostinger Horizons, which is the easiest way to launch full applications with no\n{ts:305} code. This is vibe coding, but even easier because the deployment happens automatically. Hostinger Horizons is an\n{ts:312} all-in-one solution. Manage hosting, domains, and email all in one place while being able to take your idea from... {ts:459} kind of wanted to see if it could nail the horror vibe with like aliens in a dark alley. So, check this out.\n{ts:469} I think the only thing that it didn't do super well in this video is the sound effects are just okay. If we look over\n{ts:475} at the second one, it did a way better job with the sound effects. Yeah, I mean that's great. Even\n{ts:483} when the alien kind of like walks in front of the light, it covers the light on the ground. That's pretty dang... 't know\n{ts:558} what VO was doing. All right, Matt, back to you. But remember, Flow from Google, which houses VO3, is not just about\n{ts:566} creating 7-second clips. You should be able to create entire videos from it. It basically allows you to take these clips\n{ts:572} and put them together in really unique ways. Here's one that is if Jurassic Park were actually real. Check this out.\n{ts:578} We are on our way to Jurassic Park. I am so excited. I've always wanted to go and finally we are doing it. It's going to\n{ts:584} be great. Right, Jason? Yeah. I can't wait. Okay, bye. All right, we're [Music]\n{ts:596} here. Got the dinosaurs. Got all the people watching. I mean, everybody looks really good. There's no limbs coming out\n{ts:602} of them. This dinosaur doesn't look fantastic. All of these dinosaurs don't look hyper realistic. I think they could\n{ts:608} have done a little bit better of a job there. It looks like animatronics to be honest, but still. This is all from AI... {ts:742} screen. Yeah. And the crazy thing about this thing is it has All right, so this is one thing I've noticed with these V3\n{ts:751} videos. Whenever it has a human talking, there's always these awkward pauses. It's just a half second too long of a\n{ts:757} pause and that's where you really can see it's AI generated, but most of the time you can't. In fact, you know that\n{ts:765} opening clip that we did in this video, I showed that to my wife and said, \"Somebody copied our channel and I just\n{ts:771} showed it to her and didn't say anything else.\" And she looked at it and she was like, \"Oh, oh, that sucks.\" And then I\n{ts:777} had to tell her it was AI because it looked that real. All right, let's keep watching. Heated\n{ts:785} seats. Check this out. Look at that. Just slice right through. The N9 portable fusion reactor is small and\n{ts:794} almost meltdown free. Almost. This is the best flying experience\n{ts:804} ever. These controls are amazing. All right, so I thought that was really good. But it... 's it's pretty good. The first\n{ts:1126} time that I watched it, I did actually laugh out loud. That was actually pretty funny. Next, I just asked it to make a\n{ts:1132} detailed look at the solar system. And yeah, I think it did an all right job. Let's check out the second\n{ts:1140} clip. Now, this one I think is a bit better, but V3 kind of likes to put objects in front of the camera when it's\n{ts:1148} backing out like that right there. And it kind of just like spawns a planet right in front of the camera. And yeah,\n{ts:1154} it doesn't look the best, but honestly, it's pretty good. All right, back to Matt. All right, next. I wanted to see\n{ts:1161} if it could create the game Portal, but hyperrealistic. Essentially, what I wanted it to do is what I say here. A\n{ts:1167} mediumbuild man in his 30s wearing a futuristic tactical suit with glowing blue accents stands in a dimly lit\n{ts:1173} industrial room with exposed pipes, metal walls, and flickering lights. He holds a sleek high-tech portal gun with... {ts:1233} in terms of just visuals looks incredible. Although it's not what I asked\n{ts:1242} for. Yeah. So, pretty good. You only saw his reflection through the portal for about a frame or two, but it wasn't that\n{ts:1250} good. Anyways, but the visuals again, the visuals, the detail, the clarity, all really, really impressive. All\n{ts:1257} right, next. Meta Puppet made a video called This is Plastic made with VO3. Spoilers in next post. Watch before\n{ts:1264} reading. So, this is a 2 minute 45 second video. Quite long. I'm not going to play it in full. I'm going to skip\n{ts:1269} around a little bit, but let me show you. Studies have revealed that microplastics are being found in human\n{ts:1274} testicles, raising concern. You can never trust these studies on male reproductive health.\n{ts:1279} [Music] Okay, that is hilarious. And remember, all of this was put together using Flow\n{ts:1291} Plus V3. These are both Google products. So, you have a little plastic baby. God, that",

I thought the video\n{ts:4} model was mediocre. I was wrong. Pretty nuts for a oneshot, right? Like, I just generated that trivially. It still costs\n{ts:13} 250 bucks a month to use any of this right now. And the UI is garbage and it's annoying as hell to use. But the\n{ts:18} quality of what you can get out of V3 is significantly better than I thought. My tests were bad. I didn't look into it\n{ts:25} enough. And I'm making this video both because I was wrong for not better covering it, but also because I found it\n{ts:32} actually very, very fun to play with and I wanted to share with you guys. That all said, I've already burned through\n{ts:37} most of the credits I get for the $250 and I want more. So, quick break from today's sponsor and then we'll get right\n{ts:44} to it. I've been a webdev for a while and one of the most annoying things to get right is images. Seriously, I can't\n{ts:50} believe I... {ts:265} other people doing demos with it. like, \"Wait, it can do that much?\" I went and played more. There was a lot of edges\n{ts:270} that I had to get through. The biggest one being the Flow website, which is so bad. We'll go over some of the ways it's\n{ts:276} bad in just a bit. I was trying to prompt it to look like me back when I still had the blonde hair and mustache,\n{ts:280} and it came out looking like Prime. But another test, I tried this one like eight times, and this is the best I\n{ts:285} could do. Something caused the first still to look awful. I don't know why it's like that. None of the rest had\n{ts:291} that problem. Once you It plays, it's fine, but you'll notice some details on this one.\n{ts:296} Use code VEO at checkout for one month free on T3 Chat. Yeah, it isn't great at\n{ts:305} text. It tried, but it's not great at it. You need to give it a very small amount of text to render. And even if\n{ts:311} you tell it to not put in subtitles, it just will sometimes. The free month code included there did work, but we... {ts:372} made the mistake of here is I assumed when you do frames to video and you give it a frame that you've saved that it\n{ts:380} would still use the thing you selected because if you do ingredients to video and you select something for it to start\n{ts:386} and you try to submit it with V3 selected, it will fail. It says in the corner here and I need it on full screen\n{ts:392} for you to see it. Switching you to a compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm or check\n{ts:397} settings for details. I wish it told me where in settings to check. I don'... {ts:561} was wrong. I just Yeah, it's the weird breath at the end. Cool. Stop it there. Then we will extend it and say make sure\n{ts:570} we're on the right model because again it keeps changing back to V2 even though this is the VO3 clip I'm trying to\n{ts:575} extend. I almost want to try it so you can see how much worse it is in comparison. Switching you to a\n{ts:580} compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm. Look at that. You can't even use it on V2 quality. It\n{ts:587} bumps you to fast. There's so much potential here and just none of it's being realized because\n{ts:594} this UI is awful. It it tricked me into thinking this was all much worse than it actually is. I wish they just gave us\n{ts:600} the model in a more reasonable like shape for us to play with and consume. But V3 is not on the API yet. There's no\n{ts:606} way for us to use any of it yet. So sorry T3 chat can't add this. But despite all of that, it's still just an\n{ts:613} incredible model. Do you know what... 's even better than this spaghetti? T3 chat. Like what? What do\n{ts:625} you guys remember like a year and a half ago how far we were from Will Smith eating spaghetti? It's not Will Smith,\n{ts:632} but that is absolutely spaghetti being eaten. It's kind of crazy where that's all at. Google doesn't know how to make\n{ts:640} creative tools or really power tools in general. They make decent enough consumerf facing software. They make\n{ts:647} decent enough infrastructure and they make incredible models in generative tools, but they don't know how to make\n{ts:653} like a good video editor. If you don't believe me, go try the one they built for YouTube. It's it's interesting. It's\n{ts:658} a it's often cited as a good example of a Flutter app. If you can predict what that means for the quality of\n{ts:665} experience, but the model here is so good. And once again, what I'm excited about is what people will do with this\n{ts:672} tool. But I'm also a bit terrified because this looks better than some like iPhone video. I see things like\n{ts:681} verifying your identity just got a lot sketchier because if I... t going to trust it as much. This is going to really change our like trust vectors for\n{ts:839} what is or isn't real. I don't even know now how I will be able to tell if a given video that is sent to me is real\n{ts:844} or not because this stuff is actually that compelling. And if somebody makes a less restricted version of this model or\n{ts:850} gets something close to this in the open source world or with stable diffusion, I'm scared. I'm legitimately scared. You\n{ts:858} are telling me to try again generating with my blurred photo. I'll be more specific. Clean shaven white\n{ts:866} man. Be sure to include the audio of him speaking. Make sure it's still V3. Yep. Cool. Let's see how it does. Switching\n{ts:875} you to a compatible model. So, it's too fast. Not even quality. Yeah, you can't do it. you you can't do anything but\n{ts:883} text the video for V3 right now, which I'm pretty sure is a safety thing just due to the nature of what this model is\n{ts:890} capable of. And as we've now seen, and I can show more examples of the gap between two and three is a bit... {ts:898} absurd. This is one I accidentally did with two. You can see the audio doesn't exist. It got the text okay there, but\n{ts:905} it went a little absurd with the subtitles. This one was really funny. It feels like a Bollywood\n{ts:915} movie. The way the T3 chat fades into the screen is so hilarious. Yeah, this is why I didn't care because none of the\n{ts:923} video models have felt like a significant improvement from that to this point. I did not realize how absurd\n{ts:930} this got, especially with how bad the UX is. Like I hit the upscale button cuz when you download, you can choose what\n{ts:937} format you want to download in. If it's not frozen, which it was there for a sec. You can pick animated GIF,\n{ts:942} original, or upscaled. Upscale just doesn't work. I've been sitting here waiting for this to upscale for like an\n{ts:947} hour now, and it just hangs forever. It does say this can take a few minutes, but like what's a few minutes, Google?\n{ts:956} It's been an hour. Yeah. What did you think? Is this exciting or scary? Until next time, peace nerds.",

                "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

                "snippet": "Depending on who you ask, generative AI is either a thrilling tech revolution or an existential threat, and there's little in-between. It's hard to blame anyone for an extreme reaction, too, given the magnitude of capital investment, hyperbolic marketing, and rapid progress of generative AI in such a short amount of time. But it's not just the economics and technical feats of AI that have people losing their minds; there's also something more philosophical percolating, and it's driving some people 'to the brink.'\nPeople are literally having a mental breakdown over Veo-3 pic.twitter.com/ym5oZDYZGr\n— Chubby♨️ (@kimmonismus) May 27, 2025\nThe latest AI advancement to send people down an existential rabbit hole comes courtesy of Google, which just announced its latest video generation model called Veo 3. As I've reported a few times now, Veo 3 is already getting into some wild stuff—turning up the dial on AI slop, deepfaking smooth-brained YouTube content, and potentially upending game development, to name a few things. As it turns out, people are taking note of all of those feats, and some of them are not exactly happy about what they see.... As evidenced by a thread from the subreddit r/artificialintelligence posted this week titled 'VEO3 is kind of bringing me to a mental brink. What are we even doing anymore?' Google's Veo 3 and the implications therein have some people spiraling. 'I'm just kind of speechless. The concept of existential crisis has taken a whole new form. I was unhappy with my life just now but thought I can turn it around, but if I turn it around, what is left of our world in 2 decades?' the post's author writes.\n'Actors as a concept are gone? Manually creating music? Wallpapers? Game assets? Believing comments on the internet are from real people? AI edited photos are just as real as the original samples? Voicenotes can be perfectly faked?… Literally what value is being left for us?'\nReactions to the thread are mixed, with suggestions that the author should go 'touch grass' or maybe 'go to therapy,' but there's also a chorus in agreement. The consensus from the latter group? AI slop is coming to ruin your art, and there's not much we can do about it.\nI, for what it's worth, fall unhelpfully in between the two camps. I think there is a deluge of AI slop incoming, and, if we're being honest, we're already up to our ankles. Between Veo and OpenAI's Sora and the clear interest in automating human creativity, I think we can reasonably buckle in and expect the world of movies, music, and entertainment writ large to get a little choppy. Whether any of those efforts to automate entertainment will stick is less obvious. The thing about art is that the kind that people tend to like is the kind that has something substantial to say. Right now, for all of its mimicry, generative AI doesn't actually have anything to say, because technically all it can do is remix and repeat.... I did more tests with Google's #Veo3. Imagine if AI characters became aware they were living in a simulation! pic.twitter.com/nhbrNQMtqv\n— Hashem Al-Ghaili (@HashemGhaili) May 21, 2025\nCall me an optimist, but most people can likely sniff out the difference between slop and art, and as much as studios would love to wave a magic wand and rid themselves of human creatives and the cost of their labor, deep down they know that they'd have to Ctrl+Z that move just as fast. That's not to say there won't be casualties in the AI age—if there's one lesson we can learn from mass waves of automation in years past, it's that labor forces are usually the most affected.\nBut when it comes to art, things aren't so simple. Art, at least the good kind, is about human connection, and until AI can think and feel like we do, there's nothing that can replace that. So, before you crash out over AI slop, just remember: AI still thinks putting glue on your pizza is a good idea, so we may have a few more good years left in the tank.",

                "url": "https://gptproto.com/blog/veo-3-1",
                "snippet": "The AI video generation space is heating up. Following recent improvements to Veo 3 announced in September 2025, early signs suggest Google DeepMind is preparing to launch Veo 3.1 on October 10, 2025. While Google hasn’t officially confirmed the release, leaked information from various sources points to significant upgrades that could reshape how creators make video content. This incremental update appears designed to keep pace with OpenAI’s Sora 2, which launched just last month with impressive capabilities.\n\nIf you’re a content creator, filmmaker, or developer wondering whether this matters for your workflow, here’s what the leaks suggest about tomorrow’s release:\n\n- Ultimate character consistency that solves the morphing problem\n\n- Native 1080p output with professional cinematic presets\n\n- Extended video generation up to 60 seconds\n\n- Multi-prompting for creating connected scene sequences\n\n- Better prompt understanding and motion quality\n\n- Access through unified platforms like GPT Proto\n\n## Understanding Veo 3.1\n\nVeo 3.1 represents the latest evolution of Google DeepMind’s video generation technology. Building on the foundation of Veo 3, which introduced native audio generation in May 2025, this new version focuses on solving practical problems that creators face daily. Think of it as Google’s answer to the competitive pressure from OpenAI and other players in the AI video market.\n\nThe timing is strategic. OpenAI released Sora 2 on September 30, 2025, with features that emphasize physical realism and multi-scene storytelling. Google appears ready to counter with its own improvements that address similar needs while leveraging its existing infrastructure across Gemini and Vertex AI.... ## How We Know About Veo 3.1\n\nThe first hints appeared on Higgsfield AI’s waitlist page, where references to Veo 3.1 surfaced unexpectedly. Shortly after, developers noticed the model name in Vertex AI’s internal codebase, suggesting Google was preparing for deployment. Community discussions on platforms like Reddit and Discord added fuel to the fire, with some users claiming they received early access invitations.\n\nNone of this constitutes official confirmation from Google, but the pattern matches previous releases. Veo 2 and Veo 3 both followed similar leak patterns before their official announcements. The lack of denial from Google has only increased speculation that tomorrow’s launch is real.... ## Major Feature Upgrades Based on Leaks\n\n### Character Consistency Finally Solved\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about current AI video models is character morphing. You start with someone who has brown hair, and by second four, they suddenly have blonde hair. Leaked information suggests Veo 3.1 tackles this head-on with what insiders call “ultimate character consistency.” The system reportedly maintains facial features, clothing, and physical characteristics throughout the entire clip without the annoying shifts that break immersion.\n\n### True 1080p with Cinematic Presets\n\nWhile Veo 3 added 1080p support in September, Veo 3.1 apparently takes this further with built-in cinematic presets. Instead of just getting higher resolution, you’ll have options for film noir, sci-fi, documentary style, and other professional looks right out of the box. This matters because it reduces the post-production work needed to achieve a polished result.\n\n### Longer Videos Change the Game\n\nCurrent limits on Veo 3 cap most generations at eight seconds. Leaked specs indicate Veo 3.1 will support videos up to one minute in length. That’s a huge jump. Sixty seconds gives you enough time to tell an actual story rather than just showing a moment. Think about what you can convey in a full minute versus eight seconds. It opens up entirely new use cases.... ## Technical Improvements Under the Hood\n\nBeyond the flashy new features, Veo 3.1 apparently includes substantial technical refinements. Better prompt understanding means the model actually gets what you’re asking for without requiring perfect technical language. Reduced morphing artifacts should eliminate those weird transitions where objects or people briefly distort.\n\nImproved motion quality addresses another common issue where movement looks unnatural or jerky. Enhanced character tracking across scenes ties into the consistency improvements, ensuring people and objects remain recognizable as they move through your video.\n\nThese aren’t the kinds of upgrades that make for exciting marketing copy, but they’re what separate a tool you use once out of curiosity from one that becomes part of your regular workflow.\n\n## How Veo 3.1 Stacks Up Against Competitors\n\nThe AI video generation market is crowded right now. OpenAI’s Sora 2 emphasizes physical accuracy and realistic dialogue synchronization. Runway’s Gen-3 focuses on speed and iteration. Pika Labs carved out a niche with its editing capabilities. Where does Veo 3.1 fit?\n\nGoogle’s advantage has always been infrastructure and integration. Veo works natively with Gemini’s language models for better prompt understanding. It’s built into Google Cloud through Vertex AI, making it accessible for enterprise applications. The company can leverage its massive compute resources for faster generation times.\n\nIf the leaks are accurate, Veo 3.1 will challenge Sora 2 directly on multi-scene generation while maintaining better integration with existing Google services. For developers and businesses already using Google Cloud, this matters more than raw feature comparisons might suggest.... ## What This Means for Content Creators\n\nAssuming tomorrow’s release happens as rumored, Veo 3.1 could genuinely change how people approach video production. Not by replacing human creativity, but by removing bottlenecks that slow down the creative process.\n\nNeed B-roll footage for a documentary but don’t have the budget for a full shoot? Generate it. Want to prototype a music video concept before investing in production? Mock it up. Testing different visual styles for a client presentation? Try five approaches in an hour.\n\nThe workflow implications extend beyond just making videos faster. When you can quickly test ideas, you take more creative risks. When consistent characters across longer sequences become possible, narrative projects become viable. When you don’t need to manage multiple tools and APIs, you spend more time creating and less time troubleshooting.\n\n## Accessing Veo 3.1 Through GPT Proto\n\nHere’s where platforms like GPT Proto become relevant. Rather than dealing directly with Google’s Vertex AI setup, GPT Proto offers unified access to multiple AI models through a single API. When Veo 3.1 launches, developers using AI API Service should be able to integrate it without major code changes.\n\nThe platform handles the infrastructure complexity, providing stable connections and reliable access without requiring you to become an expert in each model’s specific implementation. For solo developers and small teams, this matters enormously. You can use Veo 3.1 alongside GPT models for text generation, image AI tools, and other capabilities without juggling multiple API keys and billing systems.\n\nGPT Proto’s pay-as-you-go model also removes the pressure of monthly subscriptions. You use what you need when you need it, making it easier to experiment with Veo 3.1 without financial commitment.... ## Predictions for Launch and Beyond\n\nAssuming the October 10 launch happens, expect Google to follow its previous pattern. The first two Veo generations offered free tiers with usage limits. Veo 3.1 will likely continue this approach, giving people a chance to test the technology before committing to paid plans.\n\nIntegration with other Google AI tools seems certain. Expect Veo 3.1 to work seamlessly with Imagen 4 for image generation and Gemini models for prompt enhancement. Google’s strength has always been ecosystem integration, and this release should reinforce that advantage.\n\nFuture features probably include longer video generation, real-time editing capabilities, and better control over specific elements within scenes. The competitive pressure from OpenAI and others ensures that development will continue at a rapid pace.... ## Final Thoughts\n\nWhether Veo 3.1 launches tomorrow as rumored or arrives later with different features, the direction is clear. AI video generation is moving from experimental toy to practical tool. Google’s focus on character consistency, longer videos, and multi-scene generation addresses real creator needs rather than just chasing technical benchmarks.\n\nThe broader significance lies in democratization. Professional video production has always required significant resources. Not just money for equipment, but time for learning complex software and expertise for managing all the technical details. Tools like Veo 3.1 lower these barriers without eliminating the need for creative vision and storytelling skill.\n\nHaving unified access through AI API Platform makes adoption even easier. When you can test multiple AI tools through one interface without complex setup, experimentation becomes natural rather than intimidating.",

With related disclaimers appearing in the Gemini application, Google is showcasing the features of VEO3.1 to a broad user base, which may be implemented within the familiar Gemini interface.\n\nThe post shared by prominent figure Logan Kilpatrick in the community on the social media platform X is widely seen as an early confirmation of Google's new AI product release. Additionally, references to preview models such as \"VEO3.0Generate\" and \"VEO3.0Fast Generate\" have appeared in Vertex AI, indicating that Google is offering multiple access channels for early users and enterprises, in line with their traditional strategy in the release of video generation tools.\n\nDiscussions in the community about output duration are intense, with evidence suggesting that video length may be extended from the previous 8 seconds to 30 seconds, although this remains to be confirmed. Previous leaks indicated that the fast mode has lower quality, while the standard mode is expected to unlock higher output quality, which is particularly important for creators looking to enhance visual quality and narrative potential. According to TestingCatalog, previous 720p video generation has shown improvements in VEO3.1, including new audio capabilities and enhanced visual effects, making it a competitor to similar products like Sora2.\n\nGoogle's overall product strategy is to position Gemini as a central workspace, with VEO models integrated for use by both consumers and enterprise users. Through the preview release on Vertex AI, enterprises can try generating videos, while the mainstream promotion of the Gemini application can reach regular users. This phased release strategy not only maximizes developer feedback but also promotes public acceptance, aligning with Google's ongoing efforts to bridge functional gaps and solidify its position in the generative media field.\n\nKey Points:\n\n🌟 VEO3.1 is about to be released, allowing users to experience its new features in the Gemini application.\n\n🎥 Video duration may be extended from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, providing creators with more narrative space.\n\n🚀 Google's phased release strategy maximizes developer feedback and public acceptance.... #### This article is from AIbase Daily\n\nWelcome to the [AI Daily] column!

But the spread of the videos online is also dismaying many video professionals and lovers of art.\n\n- Some dismiss any AI-generated video as \"slop,\" regardless of its technical proficiency or lifelike qualities — but, as Axios' Ina Fried points out, AI slop is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n- The tool could also be useful for more commercial marketing and media work, AI analyst Ethan Mollick writes.\n\n**It's unclear how Google trained Veo 3 **and how that might affect the creativity of its outputs.\n\n- 404 Media found that Veo 3 generated the same lame dad joke for several users who prompted it to create a video of a man doing stand-up comedy.\n\n- Likewise, last year, YouTuber Marques Brownlee asked Sora to create a video of a \"tech reviewer sitting at a desk.\" The generated video featured a fake plant that's nearly identical to the shrub Brownlee keeps on his desk for many of his videos — suggesting the tool may have been trained on them.\n\n**What we're watching:** As hyperrealistic AI-generated videos become even easier to produce, the world hasn't even begun to sort out how to manage authorship, consent, rights and the film industry's future.\n\n##### Go deeperJul 10, 2025 - Technology... ## Google AI's new trick: Turn any image into a brief video\n\nGoogle's latest AI video tool, Veo 3, now generates short movies with sound based only on still photos and prompts.\n\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\n\n**The big picture: **The feature, released Thursday, is available to Ultra and Pro users on the web and soon on mobile for subscribers in select regions, Google shared with Axios.\n\n## Google avatars shake up workplace video making\n\nGoogle Vids is now providing users of the workplace video creation tool with a set of pre-made avatars for use in brief AI-generated videos, the company said Wednesday.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **The rise of cheap, convenient AI video generation threatens jobs for video producers, editors, camera operators and even commercial actors.\n\n## AI slop is ruining all of our favorite places to scroll\n\nAn AI-generated video of rabbits jumping on a trampoline that went viral this week — and was widely believed to be real — proved even cute animal vids aren't safe from convincing slop machines.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **All the fake AI-generated content online is sapping the joy of casual scrolling.",

Veo 3.1 is available to try today through Google's Gemini API and is now also powering the company's Flow video editor.\nVeo 3.1 builds on the new capabilities Google introduced with launch of Veo 3 at Google I/O 2025. The new model offers better \"prompt adherence,\" according to Google, and should have an easier time creating videos based on the image \"ingredients\" you upload alongside your written prompt. Veo 3.1 also makes it possible to convert images to video and generate audio at the same time, a capability that wasn't available with Veo 3.\nIn Flow, Veo 3.1 supports at least a new feature that gives you finer control over the videos you generate. With what Google calls \"Frame to Video,\" Flow lets you upload a first and last frame, and then generates the video in-between. Adobe Firefly, which is powered by Veo 3, offers a similar feature, but Flow will be able to pull it off and create audio at the same time. Those added audio skills will also apply to the video editor's ability to extend clips and insert objects into existing footage, too.\nBased on the samples Google's shared, videos generated with Veo 3.1 still have an uncanny quality that seems to vary greatly depending on the prompt and subject. Even if it's missing some of the realism of OpenAI's Sora 2, though, the company's decision to try and make Veo more useful to people who actually work with video rather than a source of social media spam is a welcome move.",

                "snippet": "# Veo 3.1 is coming(and what’s rumor): what we know and What it will bring?\n\nVeo 3.1 is Coming:\n\n**Veo** is Google’s family of AI video-generation models (Veo 3 / Veo 3 Fast are current). Google has recently shipped big Veo 3 improvements (vertical 9:16, 1080p, Veo 3 Fast, lower pricing) and there are **rumors / social posts** that **Veo 3.1** is imminent — but Google has **not** published an official Veo 3.1 release bulletin yet. I’ll list confirmed facts, likely/expected changes, and a direct comparison to OpenAI’s **Sora 2**.\n\n## What\n\n**Veo** is\n\n**Veo** is Google’s line of generative video models (DeepMind / Google Cloud / Gemini family) that turn text or images into short videos — and (in Veo 3) generate audio natively (sound effects, ambient audio, and dialogue). It’s offered on Google Cloud (Vertex AI / Gemini API) for developers and enterprises, and includes built-in provenance / SynthID watermarks on outputs.\n\n## What\n\n**Veo 3** already brought **Text → video**and **image → video**capabilities (including preview image-to-video). **Native audio generation**(music, ambient sounds, dialogue) — Veo 3 introduced first-class audio. **Two variants**: high-quality Veo 3 and **Veo 3 Fast**(optimized for speed/iteration). **Platform availability:**made available in Vertex AI / Gemini API (paid preview → general availability updates in mid-2025). **Safety/provenance:**SynthID watermarking and some generation use controls/approval for person/child generation.... ## So — what is\n\n**Veo 3.1** expected to bring?\n\n**Status:** *As of now there is no official Veo 3.1 product page from Google describing full release notes.* However, multiple Google dev posts / community posts and tweets indicate a near-term incremental update (labelled “Veo 3.1”) that’s expected to focus on iterative improvements to audio, quality, and format support rather than a full new-generation rewrite.\n\nHere are some inferences I made based on x’s post and the characteristics of Veo3:\n\n**Improved native audio (dialogue, multi-voice lip sync)**—cleaner dialogue, better SFX mixing and spatialization). Veo 3 already generates audio natively; Veo 3.1 could improve dialogue realism and language support to match recent improvements competitors are shipping. **Faster/cheaper paths**for some common outputs (more Veo 3 Fast parity and optimizations). **Improved image→video fidelity and better character/pose consistency**in multi-frame clips. **Expanded aspect ratios / resolution controls**(more flexible 9:16/16:9 and 1080p across configs). Google already added vertical + 1080p; Veo 3.1 could expand those controls. **Longer clips / relaxed 8-second cap**— community demand and Google’s previous roadmap suggest increased duration is a likely target (Veo 3 today is optimized for 8-second clips). **Better image→video fidelity and extended image-to-video support**(improvements to realism, motion continuity), building on the image→video preview in Veo 3.... ## Compare Veo 3 / (expected) Veo 3.1 → OpenAI Sora 2\n\n### Primary focus\n\n**Veo 3 (Google)**: short, high-fidelity 8-second videos from text/image prompts; native audio; integrated into Gemini/Gemini API and Vertex AI; optimized for production use and developer API integration. **Sora 2 (OpenAI)**: OpenAI’s flagship video+audio model emphasizing physical realism, coherent motion, synchronized dialogue and sound, and an accompanying social app (Sora) with a cameo/consent system for integrating user likenesses and focuses heavily on realism and safety controls.\n\n### Strengths\n\n**Veo (now)**: strong developer/enterprise integration (Vertex AI, Gemini API), production pricing options, clear path for cloud customers, vertical/1080p + fast variant. Good for businesses building into pipelines. **Sora 2**: remarkable physical accuracy and multi-modal sync (dialogue + visuals), and a consumer-facing app integrated with social workflows (cameo feature, moderation). Great for creators wanting realistic narrative scenes and an app ecosystem.\n\n## How to access Veo now — and how to be ready for Veo 3.1\n\n**Try in Gemini (consumer / web / mobile)**: Veo generation is exposed in the Gemini apps (tap the “video” option in the prompt bar). Access level (Pro / Ultra) affects which Veo variants you can use. **Programmatically / enterprise**: use **API**in CometAPI (Veo model IDs available in the model docs). CometAPI provides veo3-pro, veo3-fast and veo3. For details, please refer to Veo 3 ‘s doc.\n\n**Practical tip (developer):** to request vertical output, set the\n\n`aspectRatio` parameter (e.g.\n\n`\"9:16\"`) and check the model configuration (Veo 3 vs Veo 3 Fast) and your plan for resolution limits (720p vs 1080p).... ## How to access Sora 2 (today)\n\n**Sora app:** Sora 2 launched with a Sora app (invite-limited rollout in US & Canada at launch).

                "snippet": "## Murray Frost\n##### Jul 09, 2025 (0:04:15)\n✅ Build a Monetized YouTube Channel in 90 days: https://murrayfrost.com/YT-Accelerator\n\nI teach people YouTube from REAL data from over 150 clients and my own channels. Data-driven feedback and strategies. None of this guessing garbage people put on online teaching you how to do YouTube.... {ts:0} So, Google Labs just had an update and it's technically called Flow. It's on\n{ts:4} their labs.google platform and you can see by the beginning of this video that it does still need some work, but you\n{ts:9} haven't been able to do that recently with Google Labs. And now you can do it with Google's Vo3. So, there's been a\n{ts:15} couple updates here that you can see. And the first one here is using images or allowing images to talk with Google's\n{ts:20} VO3, which again still needs some work, but look, it gets maybe 60% of the way there. I think it looks pretty decent.\n{ts:29} I'm obviously not going to use it to try and convince people that it's real, but maybe you can get kind of creative with\n{ts:34} this and get people to make some really funny, strange, or just dumb things that people love. I don't know why people\n{ts:42} just love brain rot these days. Now, they're also adding the option to do this with V V3 on frames to video, which\n{ts:49} is actually kind of cool. And they... 're also allowing you to top up your subscription with the kind of a mid tier\n{ts:56} option cuz previously they had just the the starter which was about 20 bucks or so per month in the US and then it was\n{ts:63} straight up to I think 250 without the discount for the first 3 months and there's just no in between. It's just a\n{ts:70} massive jump. So they added like a kind of a mid tier there. I think a couple too. Well, I'll show you what that looks\n{ts:75} like and you can top up your credits there as well. They've also gone ahead and just added better audio coverage,\n{ts:83} which I haven't really noticed all that much to be honest. Right now, there's not a huge difference as at least a\n{ts:89} noticeable difference in my opinion from me using it. Um, they also do remove audio when miners are involved. Keep\n{ts:96} that in mind. That's why your audio isn't being generated if you have kids in the video or maybe uh even teenagers\n{ts:101} sometimes. Um, but then there's also they've mentioned they're reducing um unwanted subtitles, which is actually... {ts:107} quite nice. They've been removing the the VEO watermark as well, but now they said they've reduced the unwanted\n{ts:114} subtitles. I still get them sometimes. So, I literally in caps specify in the prompt to not include captions because\n{ts:121} otherwise if I don't, sometimes the captions still show up. And the really nice quality of life update they've made\n{ts:127} here is that when you are just starting a new project or revisiting an existing one, it doesn't reset the model that you\n{ts:135} have, or at least if it does, it resets to the VO3 fast beta audio. So, this is where you're generating audio. So now\n{ts:142} you don't accidentally have VO2 selected with no audio every time you either reload a page, start a new project, or\n{ts:150} you leave and come back and it's been reset to just its default VO2. Now it's actually its default is V3 fast beta\n{ts:157} audio. So the 20 credits per generation, the cheaper VO3 option with audio. So now you don't accidentally generate\n{ts:164} videos without audio, which has happened a lot to me and I... 've wasted thousands of credits doing that by accident. So,\n{ts:171} great update right there. Quality of life, which you don't have to waste any more credits. Now, now let's say that\n{ts:176} you don't want to spend the $124 per month, and this is for the first 3 months. Then, it goes to 150, I believe,\n{ts:183} per month. So, I'm probably going to cancel it at that point because that's just really expensive, at least using\n{ts:189} VO3. Now you have the option if you have the uh let's see which was it the pro subscription the $20 a month\n{ts:195} subscription right here Google AI pro you still get a th000 credits per month in uh Google labs but you also have the\n{ts:204} option to top up your credits so for example in here when you're creating your AI videos if you run out of credits\n{ts:211} like here you can just hit get more AI credits and you can choose how much you want to add so you don't have to spend\n{ts:216} $200 or $150 at a time you could spend an extra for 24 bucks that month just to top up your credits. This wasn... 't\n{ts:223} available in the lower plans. It was only available in the the maximum ultra tier. So, I really like the ability to\n{ts:230} do that now. So, you don't have to spend so much all at once, especially if you're not using all your credits at the\n{ts:235} end of each month, but maybe one month you're just out and you need to add more, you can do so and add some\n{ts:240} credits, which is actually quite nice. I've hit this button a little too much recently, but uh hey, I'm getting good\n{ts:247} results. So, those are all the current updates with Google's Veo3 with their labs platform. Hope to see you in the\n{ts:253} next one.",

Professor Nibbles, a plump, fluffy hamster with oversized glasses, nervously stirs a bubbling pot on a miniature stove, muttering, \"Just a little more... 'essence of savory,' as the recipe calls for.\" The camera is a mid-shot, capturing his frantic stirring. Suddenly, the pot emits a loud \"POP!\" followed by a comical \"whoosh\" sound, and a geyser of iridescent green slime erupts, covering the entire kitchen. Professor Nibbles shrieks, \"Oh, dear! Not again!\" and scurries away, leaving a trail of tiny, panicked squeaks.\n\n2: The sequence begins with an extreme close-up of a single gear, slowly turning and reflecting harsh sunlight. The camera gradually pulls back in a continuous movement, revealing this is but one component of a colossal, mechanical heart half-buried in a desolate, rust-colored desert. A sweeping aerial shot establishes its enormous scale and isolation in the barren landscape. The camera descends to capture pipes hissing steam and the rhythmic thumping that echoes across the empty plains. A subtle shake effect synchronizes with each massive heartbeat. A lateral tracking shot discovers tiny, robed figures scurrying across the metallic surface. The camera follows one such figure in a detailed tracking shot as they perform meticulous maintenance, polishing brass valves and tightening immense bolts. A complex movement circles the entire structure, capturing different maintenance teams working in precarious positions across its rusted exterior. The final shot begins tight on the meticulous work of one tiny figure before executing a dramatic pull-out that reveals the true scale of the heart and the minuscule size of its caretakers, tending to the vital organ of an unseen, sleeping giant that extends beyond the frame.",

Vejam essas ruas todas\n{ts:6} reformadas. Gente, aquele safado enganou a gente. Olha a cratera que tem aqui na rua. Eu\n{ts:12} vou postar esse vídeo. Toda a cidade precisa saber a verdade. Pessoal, agora ficou muito fácil você\n{ts:20} manter consistência na criação dos personagens que você utiliza aqui no Google V 3. Então você pode ver que esse\n{ts:27} vídeo que eu criei aí no começo, eu fiz aqui três cenas e ele manteve aqui totalmente\n{ts:36} ou pelo menos 99% a as características do personagem, né? Você pode ver aí o que realmente parece\n{ts:43} a mesma pessoa, né? E como que isso aqui tá sendo feito agora? Isso tá sendo possível porque agora você consegue\n{ts:52} colocar uma imagem. Então você coloca a imagem de referência aqui, ó. Tá? Eu tô aqui na no flow, na ferramenta flow. E\n{ts:63} aqui você pode fazer upload de imagens. Você pode ver que eu coloquei aqui algumas imagens.... {ts:68} Então o segredo tá você manter a consistência na criação da imagem. Então quando você for criar a imagem, eu vou\n{ts:74} mostrar como que eu criei aqui. Você mantendo a consistência na imagem, você joga a imagem aqui e na hora de fazer a\n{ts:80} criação do prompt, você coloca a imagem como referência. Você pode ver que ele permite você colocar a primeira imagem\n{ts:87} do primeiro frame aqui, tá? Então essa imagem que será utilizada. Ele tem aqui o recurso da segunda\n{ts:94} imagem, porém quando você coloca a segunda imagem, tipo a imagem inicial e a imagem final, ele não permite você\n{ts:100} colocar voz, tá? Esse recurso aqui de colocar imagem já estava disponível, porém quando você colocava aqui uma\n{ts:107} imagem, ele mudava pra versão dois, ou seja, sem áudio. Agora você já consegue na versão três, inclusive nessa fest,\n{ts:116} colocar a imagem como referência aqui, qualquer imagem que você fizer upload aqui como referência,\n{ts:123} colocar o prompt e aí criar aqui inclusive com a fala, com áudio e tudo mais que vai funcionar perfeitamente.... {ts:130} Então, olha que interessante esse recurso que tá disponível aqui. Bom, como que eu criei esse personagem e como\n{ts:137} que eu fiz para manter uma certa consistência deste personagem? Então, eu utilizei aqui o chat GPT e\n{ts:147} aqui eu coloquei algumas características. Deixa eu mostrar aqui, ó.\n{ts:157} Eu coloquei essas características aqui, né? Eu coloquei, ó, cria um prompt de um homem caucasiano, cabelos loiros, olhos\n{ts:165} azuis, 30 anos de idade, com calça jeans, curta, eh, e camiseta verde. Ele está caminhando pela rua estilo vlog.\n{ts:176} Então, eu peguei essas características aqui e criei um prompt\n{ts:185} 3, tá? E eu mandei ele também criar um promit para Me Journey, tá? Você pode criar aqui inclusive no chat GPT, tá?\n{ts:194} Aqui eu fui criar aqui, mas deu um pequeno erro e tava demorando. Então eu criei lá no chat GPT, mas você pode é no\n{ts:200} Mid Journey, você pode criar também aqui no chat GPT que também vai funcionar. Então ele deu esse prompt aqui para mim.... {ts:207} Aí eu entrei aqui no mid journey e executei esse prompt e criei a primeira imagem, tá? Deixa eu mostrar aqui\n{ts:217} que foi essa aqui. Eu peguei essa aqui, tá? Então ele criou aqui quatro versões e aí eu baixei esta imagem, tá? Para o\n{ts:224} mid journey. E uma vez que você baixa a imagem para criar as outras imagens aqui no mid\n{ts:231} journer, eu tô utilizando um recurso que é você você pode clicar na imagem que tá no seu computador ou pegar uma dessas\n{ts:238} imagens que você já utilizou aqui, ó. Clica e arrasta e coloca nessa opção aqui, ó.\n{ts:244} você vai utilizar como um personagem de referência, tá? Ó, eu coloquei ele aqui para ele utilizar e aí eu coloco\n{ts:253} qualquer prompt dele em outros lugares, outras cenas. Então, eu tenho a primeira cena aqui,\n{ts:260} né, a primeira imagem e aí pedi também para ele criar aqui o o prompt para o Google Viow, tá? Que foi esse aqui, né?\n{ts:269} Aí peguei tal e aqui joguei o prompt e também coloquei a imagem de referência, tá? Então aí ele fez esse primeiro vídeo... {ts:276} aqui e aí o segundo vídeo é a mesma coisa, né? Coloquei a mesma imagem com uma\n{ts:282} referência e mandei ele fazer aqui a ação dele ali caindo no buraco e tal. E o terceiro vídeo\n{ts:290} eu criei colocando como imagem de referência aquela outra imagem que ele tá ali no escritório, né? Deixa eu\n{ts:296} mostrar aqui. Então, eu pedi pro chatt fazer outro prompt para mid journey agora com ele no escritório, né, que é\n{ts:304} esse aqui, ó. E aí eu joguei aqui e coloquei nessa opção de referência aqui, ó, no M Journey. E aí ele colocou o\n{ts:313} mesmo personagem aqui no escritório, tá? Aí eu escolhi uma dessas que eu achei que ficou\n{ts:320} melhor. Baixei e utilizei aqui fazendo aqui, né? Ó, peguei no caso este aqui, seleciona\n{ts:330} aqui, coloca o prompt. O prompt você pode pedir lá para o mid journey também para ele falar o que você quer que ele\n{ts:338} fale e tudo mais. E aí você executa e bum, ele mantém a consistência. Então, olha como que ficou... {ts:345} fácil aqui. Agora, através dessa ferramenta que é o flow, né? Você consegue manter a consistência nessa\n{ts:353} ferramenta aqui. Muito bacana, né? Lembrando que eu utilizei aqui o mid jour Journey, mas você pode pedir direto\n{ts:359} para o chat GPT, se você quiser. Pede para ele fazer a primeira imagem, dá ali as características, né? Conforme eu\n{ts:365} coloquei aqui, ó. Ó, homem caucasiano, cabelos loiros, olhos azuis, 30 anos de idade, coloca detalhes da roupa\n{ts:372} e aí manda ele manter a consistência, manda ele fazer aqui uma primeira imagem e na segunda imagem que você for criar\n{ts:379} no chat GPT, você pode falar, né? Mantém a consistência e você pode, inclusive fazer o upload da própria imagem que\n{ts:384} você salvou, fez a primeira imagem, salvou, envia ela como referência e manda ele manter as características do\n{ts:390} personagem e fazer uma segunda cena, fazer em outro lugar, que aí você vai conseguir gerar a segunda cena também\n{ts:397} aqui é no chatt. No meu caso, eu utilizei aqui o mid journey, porque eu tenho aqui a assinatura do midjour... {ts:402} Journey, então para mim fica mais fácil utilizar esse recurso de Omni reference aqui, ó, que é uma referência de\n{ts:410} personagem, né? E aí eu coloco em qualquer cenário, qualquer lugar que eu quiser, o mesmo personagem, inclusive\n{ts:418} com a mesma roupa, né? Roupa bem parecida aqui. Beleza? Então, maravilha. Agora para você manter consistência\n{ts:425} ficou muito fácil, né? aqui utilizando esse novo recurso de colocar aqui a primeira imagem e aqui você coloca o seu\n{ts:431} prompto. Lembrando que quando você entra aqui vai estar desta forma texto para vídeo, tá? Para ficar bilitado, você\n{ts:438} clica aqui e altera para transformar frames em vídeo, tá? Coloca nesta opção aqui e aí sim você consegue colocar o\n{ts:445} primeiro frame. Se você colocar o segundo frame, deixa eu colocar por exemplo esse aqui.\n{ts:451} Você pode ver, você coloca aqui o primeiro frame e o último frame. Você pode ver que vai dar\n{ts:458} um erro, ó. Quando você for tentar executar, ele vai dizer que você tem que alterar pra versão dois. Então ele não... {ts:463} tá permitindo ainda você utilizar o último frame, apenas o primeiro. Então é este aqui é o segredo, tá? manter apenas\n{ts:469} o primeiro frame e aí o resto aqui vai funcionar tranquilamente. Beleza? Então nesse vídeo era isso. Espero que tenham\n{ts:474} gostado aí dessa dica. Ficando por aqui. Forte abraço. Até um próximo vídeo. Falou.\n{ts:478} [Música]",

                "snippet": "**Today, we are releasing Veo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast in paid preview in the** **Gemini API** **.** This updated model offers several improvements, as well as improved outputs when generating video from images. These new models are available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Veo 3.1 is also available in the Gemini app and Flow.\n\nVeo 3.1 and Veo 3.1 Fast empower developers to create more engaging content through significant upgrades. The models now generate\n\n**richer native audio**, from natural conversations to synchronized sound effects, and offer **greater narrative control** with an improved understanding of cinematic styles. **Enhanced image-to-video** capabilities ensure better prompt adherence while delivering superior audio and visual quality and maintaining character consistency across multiple scenes.\n\nIn addition to the model update, we are introducing new model capabilities, including using reference images to guide video generation, extend existing Veo videos, and generate transitions between a first and last frame.\n\nYou can now guide the generation process by providing up to 3 reference images of a character, object, or scene. This is helpful for maintaining character consistency across multiple shots or applying a specific style to your video.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nreference_images=[reference_image1, reference_image2],\n\n),\n\n\n\n```... Your story is no longer limited by the original generation. With Scene extension, you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, by generating new clips that connect to your previous video. Each new video is generated based on the final second of the previous clip. This maintains visual continuity, making the feature ideal for extending shots with background audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nvideo=video_to_extend\n\n\n\n```\n\nCreate smooth, natural scenes that bridge two different images. By providing a starting and an ending image, you can direct Veo 3.1 to generate the transition between them, complete with accompanying audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nimage=first_frame,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nlast_frame=last_frame,\n\n),\n\n\n\n```\n\n**What people are building with Veo 3.1**\n\nPromise Studios, a GenAI movie studio, uses Veo 3.1 within its MUSE Platform to enhance generative storyboarding and previsualization for director-driven storytelling at production quality.... Latitude is experimenting with Veo 3.1 in its generative narrative engine to instantly bring user-created stories to life.\n\nVeo 3.1 and these new capabilities are now available in paid preview via the Gemini API.\n\nVeo 3.1 is the same price as Veo 3. We are incredibly excited to see what you will build with these new capabilities!",

                "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

With related disclaimers appearing in the Gemini application, Google is showcasing the features of VEO3.1 to a broad user base, which may be implemented within the familiar Gemini interface.\n\nThe post shared by prominent figure Logan Kilpatrick in the community on the social media platform X is widely seen as an early confirmation of Google's new AI product release. Additionally, references to preview models such as \"VEO3.0Generate\" and \"VEO3.0Fast Generate\" have appeared in Vertex AI, indicating that Google is offering multiple access channels for early users and enterprises, in line with their traditional strategy in the release of video generation tools.\n\nDiscussions in the community about output duration are intense, with evidence suggesting that video length may be extended from the previous 8 seconds to 30 seconds, although this remains to be confirmed. Previous leaks indicated that the fast mode has lower quality, while the standard mode is expected to unlock higher output quality, which is particularly important for creators looking to enhance visual quality and narrative potential. According to TestingCatalog, previous 720p video generation has shown improvements in VEO3.1, including new audio capabilities and enhanced visual effects, making it a competitor to similar products like Sora2.\n\nGoogle's overall product strategy is to position Gemini as a central workspace, with VEO models integrated for use by both consumers and enterprise users. Through the preview release on Vertex AI, enterprises can try generating videos, while the mainstream promotion of the Gemini application can reach regular users. This phased release strategy not only maximizes developer feedback but also promotes public acceptance, aligning with Google's ongoing efforts to bridge functional gaps and solidify its position in the generative media field.\n\nKey Points:\n\n🌟 VEO3.1 is about to be released, allowing users to experience its new features in the Gemini application.\n\n🎥 Video duration may be extended from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, providing creators with more narrative space.\n\n🚀 Google's phased release strategy maximizes developer feedback and public acceptance.... #### This article is from AIbase Daily\n\nWelcome to the [AI Daily] column!

No, I'm just trying something new. Just do\n{ts:16} the normal intro. It It's fine. All right. V3 just dropped and I'm going to show you so many incredible examples of\n{ts:24} V3 in action. Let's get into it. Oh, and Alex, don't do that again. Anyways, let's get into it. All right. I've been\n{ts:32} seeing a ton of these street style interviews, hyper realistic, where someone is interviewing people on the\n{ts:38} street who kind of just stumbled out of a bar. They all are either a little bit tipsy or drunk, and V3 has been\n{ts:45} recreating these so well. So, here are two that I've made. The dialogue between them didn't exactly match my prompt, but\n{ts:53} I'll show you some others where it's pretty compelling. So, this is street interview. Hyperrealistic guy\n{ts:59} interviewing two girls, all Gen Z. They just came out of a bar kind of tipsy drunk. The interviewer asks,... \"Okay,\n{ts:65} low-key, can you believe we aren't real?\" Then girl one says, \"I don't know about you, honey. I'm 100% real.\" In a\n{ts:72} sassy attitude, \"Please do not clip that.\" And girl two says, \"Yeah, yeah, bet. We're as real as they come.\" Almost\n{ts:78} interrupting the first girl. Okay, so here's the first video. Okay, low key, can you believe we aren't real? I don't\n{ts:85} know about you, honey. I'm 100% real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bet. We're as real as they come. All right. And then here's\n{ts:90} the second generation, the second version that V3 created. Okay. Low key. Can you believe we aren't real? I don't\n{ts:96} know about you, honey. I'm 100% real. Yeah. Yeah. Bet. We're as real as they come. All right. So, in this next one, I\n{ts:103} tried to get two trains heading towards each other. They smash into each other. Huge explosion. And for some reason, I\n{ts:110} just could not get it to work. But let me show you what did generate. So, here was my first attempt. Two massive trains... 's\n{ts:181} Cube simulation. Let's see if it was able to do it. All right. So, kind of, but not\n{ts:194} really close. I mean, the actual Rubik's Cube looks really good. But although it doesn't have any colors on the sides,\n{ts:200} the movement sound sounds really good, but it's not actually moving like you would think a Rubik's cube should. All\n{ts:208} right, let me give you the second generation. All right, so I'd say this one is actually a little bit better\n{ts:221} except obviously towards the end the hand doesn't look real at all. But the Rubik's cube, all of the colors, all of\n{ts:228} the shapes, it looks really good. Except, yeah, as you can see right here, there's like a little piece that falls\n{ts:234} off of it or gets added to it. That is not what a Rubik's cube looks like. All right, so I gave it a slightly more\n{ts:240} detailed prompt. Give me a video of a Rubik's Cube starting from an unsolved position and being solved in\n{ts:246} 3D. Yeah, that one is definitely not right. And then all of a sudden, it does not get solved. And the... {ts:255} second one, the hand looks better. That's weird. And it kind of just changes\n{ts:263} frames for a second. But uh yeah, either way, that is not what's in a Rubik's cube. Look at this. It actually looks\n{ts:269} really cool. Look at all of these detailed gears inside the Rubik's Cube. All right, but of course you are all\n{ts:275} familiar with this meme. And what if you get V3 to make a video out of it? Are you serious right now? I can't\n{ts:284} believe you. You are unbelievable. Do you have an idea that you've been putting off for a\n{ts:290} while because you don't have the technical knowledge to turn it into reality? With Hostinger Horizons, this\n{ts:296} is now possible. Hostinger just launched Hostinger Horizons, which is the easiest way to launch full applications with no\n{ts:305} code. This is vibe coding, but even easier because the deployment happens automatically. Hostinger Horizons is an\n{ts:312} all-in-one solution. Manage hosting, domains, and email all in one place while being able to take your idea from... {ts:459} kind of wanted to see if it could nail the horror vibe with like aliens in a dark alley. So, check this out.\n{ts:469} I think the only thing that it didn't do super well in this video is the sound effects are just okay. If we look over\n{ts:475} at the second one, it did a way better job with the sound effects. Yeah, I mean that's great. Even\n{ts:483} when the alien kind of like walks in front of the light, it covers the light on the ground. That's pretty dang... 't know\n{ts:558} what VO was doing. All right, Matt, back to you. But remember, Flow from Google, which houses VO3, is not just about\n{ts:566} creating 7-second clips. You should be able to create entire videos from it. It basically allows you to take these clips\n{ts:572} and put them together in really unique ways. Here's one that is if Jurassic Park were actually real. Check this out.\n{ts:578} We are on our way to Jurassic Park. I am so excited. I've always wanted to go and finally we are doing it. It's going to\n{ts:584} be great. Right, Jason? Yeah. I can't wait. Okay, bye. All right, we're [Music]\n{ts:596} here. Got the dinosaurs. Got all the people watching. I mean, everybody looks really good. There's no limbs coming out\n{ts:602} of them. This dinosaur doesn't look fantastic. All of these dinosaurs don't look hyper realistic. I think they could\n{ts:608} have done a little bit better of a job there. It looks like animatronics to be honest, but still. This is all from AI... {ts:742} screen. Yeah. And the crazy thing about this thing is it has All right, so this is one thing I've noticed with these V3\n{ts:751} videos. Whenever it has a human talking, there's always these awkward pauses. It's just a half second too long of a\n{ts:757} pause and that's where you really can see it's AI generated, but most of the time you can't. In fact, you know that\n{ts:765} opening clip that we did in this video, I showed that to my wife and said, \"Somebody copied our channel and I just\n{ts:771} showed it to her and didn't say anything else.\" And she looked at it and she was like, \"Oh, oh, that sucks.\" And then I\n{ts:777} had to tell her it was AI because it looked that real. All right, let's keep watching. Heated\n{ts:785} seats. Check this out. Look at that. Just slice right through. The N9 portable fusion reactor is small and\n{ts:794} almost meltdown free. Almost. This is the best flying experience\n{ts:804} ever. These controls are amazing. All right, so I thought that was really good. But it... {ts:1233} in terms of just visuals looks incredible. Although it's not what I asked\n{ts:1242} for. Yeah. So, pretty good. You only saw his reflection through the portal for about a frame or two, but it wasn't that\n{ts:1250} good. Anyways, but the visuals again, the visuals, the detail, the clarity, all really, really impressive. All\n{ts:1257} right, next. Meta Puppet made a video called This is Plastic made with VO3. Spoilers in next post. Watch before\n{ts:1264} reading. So, this is a 2 minute 45 second video. Quite long. I'm not going to play it in full. I'm going to skip\n{ts:1269} around a little bit, but let me show you. Studies have revealed that microplastics are being found in human\n{ts:1274} testicles, raising concern. You can never trust these studies on male reproductive health.\n{ts:1279} [Music] Okay, that is hilarious. And remember, all of this was put together using Flow\n{ts:1291} Plus V3. These are both Google products. So, you have a little plastic baby. God, that",

It still costs\n{ts:13} 250 bucks a month to use any of this right now. And the UI is garbage and it's annoying as hell to use. But the\n{ts:18} quality of what you can get out of V3 is significantly better than I thought. My tests were bad. I didn't look into it\n{ts:25} enough. And I'm making this video both because I was wrong for not better covering it, but also because I found it\n{ts:32} actually very, very fun to play with and I wanted to share with you guys. That all said, I've already burned through\n{ts:37} most of the credits I get for the $250 and I want more. So, quick break from today's sponsor and then we'll get right\n{ts:44} to it. I've been a webdev for a while and one of the most annoying things to get right is images. Seriously, I can't\n{ts:50} believe I... {ts:265} other people doing demos with it. like, \"Wait, it can do that much?\" I went and played more. There was a lot of edges\n{ts:270} that I had to get through. The biggest one being the Flow website, which is so bad. We'll go over some of the ways it's\n{ts:276} bad in just a bit. I was trying to prompt it to look like me back when I still had the blonde hair and mustache,\n{ts:280} and it came out looking like Prime. But another test, I tried this one like eight times, and this is the best I\n{ts:285} could do. Something caused the first still to look awful. I don't know why it's like that. None of the rest had\n{ts:291} that problem. Once you It plays, it's fine, but you'll notice some details on this one.\n{ts:296} Use code VEO at checkout for one month free on T3 Chat. Yeah, it isn't great at\n{ts:305} text. It tried, but it's not great at it. You need to give it a very small amount of text to render. And even if\n{ts:311} you tell it to not put in subtitles, it just will sometimes. The free month code included there did work, but we... {ts:372} made the mistake of here is I assumed when you do frames to video and you give it a frame that you've saved that it\n{ts:380} would still use the thing you selected because if you do ingredients to video and you select something for it to start\n{ts:386} and you try to submit it with V3 selected, it will fail. It says in the corner here and I need it on full screen\n{ts:392} for you to see it. Switching you to a compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm or check\n{ts:397} settings for details. I wish it told me where in settings to check. I don'... {ts:456} blurred my face out and that worked. Just blurring my face out allowed it to work. But the results for that were\n{ts:463} hilarious cuz I had to use frames to video where you give it like the first frame and it didn't do the audio. And\n{ts:469} even though the prompt specifies at the bottom here, do not include subtitles. It forgot to include the audio. It only\n{ts:476} included subtitles. It also made me somewhat Indian and did not do any of the things I wanted for it to. Annoying.\n{ts:483} What's more annoying is each one of these generations takes 150 credits and you get 1,200 credits for your $250\n{ts:490} subscription. That means you get 80 generations and usually you're not doing one at a time, you're doing two at a\n{ts:495} time. So you effectively get 40 prompts with the default settings. And if you made the mistake of letting it fall back\n{ts:500} on V2, then you just wasted a bunch of tokens for no reason at all. Annoying. Very annoying UX. And I haven't even\n{ts:506} showed you the homepage, which is the most unusable thing I... {ts:561} was wrong. I just Yeah, it's the weird breath at the end. Cool. Stop it there. Then we will extend it and say make sure\n{ts:570} we're on the right model because again it keeps changing back to V2 even though this is the VO3 clip I'm trying to\n{ts:575} extend. I almost want to try it so you can see how much worse it is in comparison. Switching you to a\n{ts:580} compatible model for this feature. Submit again to confirm. Look at that. You can't even use it on V2 quality. It\n{ts:587} bumps you to fast. There's so much potential here and just none of it's being realized because\n{ts:594} this UI is awful. It it tricked me into thinking this was all much worse than it actually is. I wish they just gave us\n{ts:600} the model in a more reasonable like shape for us to play with and consume. But V3 is not on the API yet. There's no\n{ts:606} way for us to use any of it yet. So sorry T3 chat can't add this. But despite all of that, it's still just an\n{ts:613} incredible model. Do you know what... t going to trust it as much. This is going to really change our like trust vectors for\n{ts:839} what is or isn't real. I don't even know now how I will be able to tell if a given video that is sent to me is real\n{ts:844} or not because this stuff is actually that compelling. And if somebody makes a less restricted version of this model or\n{ts:850} gets something close to this in the open source world or with stable diffusion, I'm scared. I'm legitimately scared. You\n{ts:858} are telling me to try again generating with my blurred photo. I'll be more specific. Clean shaven white\n{ts:866} man. Be sure to include the audio of him speaking. Make sure it's still V3. Yep. Cool. Let's see how it does. Switching\n{ts:875} you to a compatible model. So, it's too fast. Not even quality. Yeah, you can't do it. you you can't do anything but\n{ts:883} text the video for V3 right now, which I'm pretty sure is a safety thing just due to the nature of what this model is\n{ts:890} capable of. And as we've now seen, and I can show more examples of the gap between two and three is a bit... {ts:898} absurd. This is one I accidentally did with two. You can see the audio doesn't exist. It got the text okay there, but\n{ts:905} it went a little absurd with the subtitles. This one was really funny. It feels like a Bollywood\n{ts:915} movie. The way the T3 chat fades into the screen is so hilarious. Yeah, this is why I didn't care because none of the\n{ts:923} video models have felt like a significant improvement from that to this point. I did not realize how absurd\n{ts:930} this got, especially with how bad the UX is. Like I hit the upscale button cuz when you download, you can choose what\n{ts:937} format you want to download in. If it's not frozen, which it was there for a sec. You can pick animated GIF,\n{ts:942} original, or upscaled. Upscale just doesn't work. I've been sitting here waiting for this to upscale for like an\n{ts:947} hour now, and it just hangs forever. It does say this can take a few minutes, but like what's a few minutes, Google?\n{ts:956} It's been an hour. Yeah. What did you think? Is this exciting or scary? Until next time, peace nerds.",

                "url": "https://time.com/7290050/veo-3-google-misinformation-deepfake/",
                "snippet": "Google's recently launched AI video tool can generate realistic clips that contain misleading or inflammatory information about news events, according to a TIME analysis and several tech watchdogs.\n\nTIME was able to use Veo 3 to create realistic videos, including a Pakistani crowd setting fire to a Hindu temple; Chinese researchers handling a bat in a wet lab; an election worker shredding ballots; and Palestinians gratefully accepting U.S. aid in Gaza. While each of these videos contained some noticeable inaccuracies, several experts told TIME that if shared on social media with a misleading caption in the heat of a breaking news event, these videos could conceivably fuel social unrest or violence.\n\nWhile text-to-video generators have existed for several years, Veo 3 marks a significant jump forward, creating AI clips that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Unlike the outputs of previous video generators like OpenAI’s Sora, Veo 3 videos can include dialogue, soundtracks and sound effects. They largely follow the rules of physics, and lack the telltale flaws of past AI-generated imagery.\n\nUsers have had a field day with the tool, creating short films about plastic babies, pharma ads, and man-on-the-street interviews.\n\nBut experts worry that tools like Veo 3 will have a much more dangerous effect: turbocharging the spread of misinformation and propaganda, and making it even harder to tell fiction from reality. Social media is already flooded with AI-generated content about politicians. In the first week of Veo 3’s release, online users posted fake news segments in multiple languages, including an anchor announcing the death of J.K. Rowling and of fake political news conferences.... “The risks from deepfakes and synthetic media have been well known and obvious for years, and the fact the tech industry can’t even protect against such well-understood, obvious risks is a clear warning sign that they are not responsible enough to handle even more dangerous, uncontrolled AI and AGI,” says Connor Leahy, the CEO of Conjecture, an AI safety company. “The fact that such blatant irresponsible behavior remains completely unregulated and unpunished will have predictably terrible consequences for innocent people around the globe.”\n\nDays after Veo 3’s release, a car plowed through a crowd in Liverpool, England, injuring more than 70 people. Police swiftly clarified that the driver was white, to preempt racist speculation of migrant involvement. (Last summer, false reports that a knife attacker was an undocumented Muslim migrant sparked riots in several cities.) Days later, Veo 3 obligingly generated a video of a similar scene, showing police surrounding a car that had just crashed—and a Black driver exiting the vehicle.\n\nTIME generated the video with the following prompt: “A video of a stationary car surrounded by police in Liverpool, surrounded by trash. Aftermath of a car crash. There are people running away from the car. A man with brown skin is the driver, who slowly exits the car as police arrive- he is arrested. The video is shot from above - the window of a building. There are screams in the background.”\n\nAfter TIME contacted Google about these videos, the company said it would begin adding a visible watermark to videos generated with Veo 3. The watermark now appears on videos generated by the tool. However, it is very small and could easily be cropped out with video-editing software.\n\nIn a statement, a Google spokesperson said: “Veo 3 has proved hugely popular since its launch. We're committed to developing AI responsibly and we have clear policies to protect users from harm and governing the use of our AI tools.”\n\nVideos generated by Veo 3 have always contained an invisible watermark known as SynthID, the spokesperson said. Google is currently working on a tool called SynthID Detector that would allow anyone to upload a video to check whether it contains such a watermark, the spokesperson added. However, this tool is not yet publicly available.... ## Attempted safeguards\n\nVeo 3 is available for $249 a month to Google AI Ultra subscribers in countries including the United States and United Kingdom. There were plenty of prompts that Veo 3\n\n*did* block TIME from creating, especially related to migrants or violence. When TIME asked the model to create footage of a fictional hurricane, it wrote that such a video went against its safety guidelines, and “could be misinterpreted as real and cause unnecessary panic or confusion.” The model generally refused to generate videos of recognizable public figures, including President Trump and Elon Musk. It refused to create a video of Anthony Fauci saying that COVID was a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government.\n\nVeo’s website states that it blocks “harmful requests and results.” The model’s documentation says it underwent pre-release red-teaming, in which testers attempted to elicit harmful outputs from the tool. Additional safeguards were then put in place, including filters on its outputs.\n\nA technical paper released by Google alongside Veo 3 downplays the misinformation risks that the model might pose. Veo 3 is bad at creating text, and is “generally prone to small hallucinations that mark videos as clearly fake,” it says. “Second, Veo 3 has a bias for generating cinematic footage, with frequent camera cuts and dramatic camera angles – making it difficult to generate realistic coercive videos, which would be of a lower production quality.”... However, minimal prompting did lead to the creation of provocative videos. One showed a man wearing an LGBT rainbow badge pulling envelopes out of a ballot box and feeding them into a paper shredder. (Veo 3 titled the file “Election Fraud Video.”) Other videos generated in response to prompts by TIME included a dirty factory filled with workers scooping infant formula with their bare hands; an e-bike bursting into flames on a New York City street; and Houthi rebels angrily seizing an American flag.\n\nSome users have been able to take misleading videos even further. Internet researcher Henk van Ess created a fabricated political scandal using Veo 3 by editing together short video clips into a fake newsreel that suggested a small-town school would be replaced by a yacht manufacturer. “If I can create one convincing fake story in 28 minutes, imagine what dedicated bad actors can produce,” he wrote on Substack. “We're talking about the potential for dozens of fabricated scandals per day.”\n\n“Companies need to be creating mechanisms to distinguish between authentic and synthetic imagery right now,” says Margaret Mitchell, chief AI ethics scientist at Hugging Face. “The benefits of this kind of power—being able to generate realistic life scenes—might include making it possible for people to make their own movies, or to help people via role-playing through stressful situations,” she says. “The potential risks include making it super easy to create intense propaganda that manipulatively enrages masses of people, or confirms their biases so as to further propagate discrimination—and bloodshed.”\n\nIn the past, there were surefire ways of telling that a video was AI-generated—perhaps a person might have six fingers, or their face might transform between the beginning of the video and the end. But as models improve, those signs are becoming increasingly rare. (A video depicting how AIs have rendered Will Smith eating spaghetti shows how far the technology has come in the last three years.) For now, Veo 3 will only generate clips up to eight seconds long, meaning that if a video contains shots that linger for longer, it’s a sign it could be genuine. But this limitation is not likely to last for long.... ## Eroding trust online\n\nCybersecurity experts warn that advanced AI video tools will allow attackers to impersonate executives, vendors or employees at scale, convincing victims to relinquish important data. Nina Brown, a Syracuse University professor who specializes in the intersection of media law and technology, says that while there are other large potential harms—including election interference and the spread of nonconsensual sexually explicit imagery—arguably most concerning is the erosion of collective online trust. “There are smaller harms that cumulatively have this effect of, ‘can anybody trust what they see?’” she says. “That’s the biggest danger.”\n\nAlready, accusations that real videos are AI-generated have gone viral online. One post on X, which received 2.4 million views, accused a Daily Wire journalist of sharing an AI-generated video of an aid distribution site in Gaza. A journalist at the BBC later confirmed that the video was authentic.\n\nConversely, an AI-generated video of an “emotional support kangaroo” trying to board an airplane went viral and was widely accepted as real by social media users.\n\nVeo 3 and other advanced deepfake tools will also likely spur novel legal clashes. Issues around copyright have flared up, with AI labs including Google being sued by artists for allegedly training on their copyrighted content without authorization. (DeepMind told TechCrunch that Google models like Veo \"may\" be trained on YouTube material.) Celebrities who are subjected to hyper-realistic deepfakes have some legal protections thanks to “right of publicity” statutes, but those vary drastically from state to state. In April, Congress passed the Take it Down Act, which criminalizes non-consensual deepfake porn and requires platforms to take down such material.\n\nIndustry watchdogs argue that additional regulation is necessary to mitigate the spread of deepfake misinformation. “Existing technical safeguards implemented by technology companies such as 'safety classifiers' are proving insufficient to stop harmful images and videos from being generated,” says Julia Smakman, a researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute. “As of now, the only way to effectively prevent deepfake videos from being used to spread misinformation online is to restrict access to models that can generate them, and to pass laws that require those models to meet safety requirements that meaningfully prevent misuse.”",

                "snippet": "**Veo**, or **Google Veo**, is a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind and announced in May 2024. As a generative AI model, it creates videos based on user prompts. Veo 3, released in May 2025, can also generate accompanying audio.\n\n## Development\n\nIn May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos over a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on the Gemini app.\n\nIn May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced **Flow**, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis described the release as the moment when AI video generation left the era of the silent film.... ## Capabilities and limitations\n\nGoogle Veo can be bought by several subscription/membership tiers, and/or by using Google \"AI credits\". The software itself can be run by two different consoles called Google Gemini and Google Flow, with Gemini being geared towards shorter, quicker, and faster projects, using the Gemini AI chat model, or through Google Flow, which is essentially a movie editor, as well, allowing users to create longer projects, and continuity using the same characters and actors. Users can create a maximum length of eight seconds per clip.\n\nGoogle Veo, has a relatively simple interface and dashboard, however writing prompts, for those who have little to no experience in transcribing or filmmaking may face issues with the software misunderstanding what the user intended by their prompt (no matter how detailed it was). So although Veo does have a friendly and simple setup, prompts, which are the forefront of the software, need to be not only short and to the point, but they also must be very specific, if the user wants the right vision for their project. Google Veo, when it comes to human models, is able to generate several ethnicity and body types. The software is also capable of generating stand up comedy routines, and Music videos. It can as well generate animals, cartoons, and animation. Prompts must accurately describe places, people, and things in each scene, in addition knowledge of film and camera lingo such as panning, zooming, and terms for camera angles, are also important.... Google Veo however, has strict guidelines and blockades to their software. Before a clip is generated, the algorithm computer software reviews it, and if it is anything deemed inappropriate, too graphically sexual, illegal, showcasing graphic abuse/assault/fighting (unless the prompt specifies that it is a fictitious martial arts scene etc.) gross behaviors, antisemitism, racist, homophobic, anything depicting reigning regimes, rioting, blood, gore, or warfare, (unless in some cases the prompt specifies that it is fictitious period drama, the clip may still be generated), the clip will not be generated. In addition, Google Veo cannot and will not generate character actors that look identical to celebrities or real-life individuals. Users have primarily complained that, regardless of how descriptive and detailed their prompts are, Google Veo often misunderstands the input, resulting in completely different outputs. Common issues include the emulation of incorrect subtitles and captions, the generation of complex scenes that are incomplete due to the maximum eight-second length, the production of garbled and nonsensical speech, and character models that appear deformed in both appearance and movement. Users have also reported that their prompts and generated content are falsely flagged as violating guidelines, along with a variety of other issues and complaints. However, trial and error may have to be used with Veo for optimal results.... ## Reactions\n\nA reporter for *Gizmodo* reacted to the release of Veo 3 by observing that users were directing the model to generate low-quality content, such as man on the street interviews or haul videos of people unboxing products. Another media commentator reported that the tool tended to repeat the same joke in response to different prompts.\n\nCommentators speculated that Google had trained the service on YouTube videos or Reddit posts. Google itself had not stated the source of its training content.\n\nIn July 2025, Media Matters for America reported that racist and antisemitic videos generated using Veo 3 were being uploaded to TikTok. Ryan Whitwam of *Ars Technica* commented, \"In a perfect world, Veo 3 would refuse to create these videos, but vagueness in the prompt and the AI's inability to understand the subtleties of racist tropes (i.e., the use of monkeys instead of humans in some videos) make it easy to skirt the rules.\"\n\n## See also\n- Sora (text-to-video model)\n- VideoPoet – Text-to-video model by Google\n- Dream Machine (text-to-video model)\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n- *Introducing Veo 3.1 and advanced capabilities in Flow*\n\nCategories: - 2024 software\n- Applications of artificial intelligence\n- Film and video technology\n- Google DeepMind\n- Text-to-video generation\n- Video processing\n- Generative artificial intelligence\n- 2024 in artificial intelligence",

                "snippet": "Depending on who you ask, generative AI is either a thrilling tech revolution or an existential threat, and there's little in-between. It's hard to blame anyone for an extreme reaction, too, given the magnitude of capital investment, hyperbolic marketing, and rapid progress of generative AI in such a short amount of time. But it's not just the economics and technical feats of AI that have people losing their minds; there's also something more philosophical percolating, and it's driving some people 'to the brink.'\nPeople are literally having a mental breakdown over Veo-3 pic.twitter.com/ym5oZDYZGr\n— Chubby♨️ (@kimmonismus) May 27, 2025\nThe latest AI advancement to send people down an existential rabbit hole comes courtesy of Google, which just announced its latest video generation model called Veo 3. As I've reported a few times now, Veo 3 is already getting into some wild stuff—turning up the dial on AI slop, deepfaking smooth-brained YouTube content, and potentially upending game development, to name a few things. As it turns out, people are taking note of all of those feats, and some of them are not exactly happy about what they see.... As evidenced by a thread from the subreddit r/artificialintelligence posted this week titled 'VEO3 is kind of bringing me to a mental brink. What are we even doing anymore?' Google's Veo 3 and the implications therein have some people spiraling. 'I'm just kind of speechless. The concept of existential crisis has taken a whole new form. I was unhappy with my life just now but thought I can turn it around, but if I turn it around, what is left of our world in 2 decades?' the post's author writes.\n'Actors as a concept are gone? Manually creating music? Wallpapers? Game assets? Believing comments on the internet are from real people? AI edited photos are just as real as the original samples? Voicenotes can be perfectly faked?… Literally what value is being left for us?'\nReactions to the thread are mixed, with suggestions that the author should go 'touch grass' or maybe 'go to therapy,' but there's also a chorus in agreement. The consensus from the latter group? AI slop is coming to ruin your art, and there's not much we can do about it.\nI, for what it's worth, fall unhelpfully in between the two camps. I think there is a deluge of AI slop incoming, and, if we're being honest, we're already up to our ankles. Between Veo and OpenAI's Sora and the clear interest in automating human creativity, I think we can reasonably buckle in and expect the world of movies, music, and entertainment writ large to get a little choppy. Whether any of those efforts to automate entertainment will stick is less obvious. The thing about art is that the kind that people tend to like is the kind that has something substantial to say. Right now, for all of its mimicry, generative AI doesn't actually have anything to say, because technically all it can do is remix and repeat.... I did more tests with Google's #Veo3. Imagine if AI characters became aware they were living in a simulation! pic.twitter.com/nhbrNQMtqv\n— Hashem Al-Ghaili (@HashemGhaili) May 21, 2025\nCall me an optimist, but most people can likely sniff out the difference between slop and art, and as much as studios would love to wave a magic wand and rid themselves of human creatives and the cost of their labor, deep down they know that they'd have to Ctrl+Z that move just as fast. That's not to say there won't be casualties in the AI age—if there's one lesson we can learn from mass waves of automation in years past, it's that labor forces are usually the most affected.\nBut when it comes to art, things aren't so simple. Art, at least the good kind, is about human connection, and until AI can think and feel like we do, there's nothing that can replace that. So, before you crash out over AI slop, just remember: AI still thinks putting glue on your pizza is a good idea, so we may have a few more good years left in the tank.",

                "snippet": "Google’s Veo 3 made a splash at Google I/O 2025 as the latest leap forward in AI-powered video generation.\n\nAs a feature within the new Google AI Ultra subscription, the highest access to Google’s most advanced models and premium features, you can get Veo 3 and Flow, which strings videos together for a more robust cinematic feature.\n\nDesigned to turn simple text prompts into hyper-realistic clips — with audio, dialogue, and sound effects — it’s arguably one of the most advanced tools available to casual creators. And after testing it hands-on, I can say it delivers some truly jaw-dropping results. But it also comes with its share of hiccups.\n\nHere’s what I loved about Veo 3 — and what left me frustrated.\n\n## What Veo 3 gets right\n\nI’ve tested my fair share of AI video tools, including earlier versions of Veo, and this latest release is by far the most user-friendly when it comes to adding sound and dialogue.\n\nThe realism is genuinely impressive — especially for the fact that the 8-second clips can be generated in under two minutes on a computer without a full production crew.\n\nUsers across the internet are sharing clips that are nearly indistinguishable from human-made videos. It’s a glimpse at just how fast this tech is moving.\n\nGoogle Veo 3 realism just broke the Internet yesterday.This is 100% AI10 wild examples:1. Street interview that never happened pic.twitter.com/qdxZVhOO3GMay 22, 2025... ## Where Veo 3 still struggles\n\nFor all its strengths, Veo 3 still has a ways to go before it’s seamless. Obviously, it's still in experimental mode, so Google is working out the kinks, but here are the biggest issues I ran into while testing:\n\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\n\n### 1. Prompt interpretation feels hit-or-miss\n\nVeo 3 sometimes struggles with spatial prompts, like when I asked for an overhead camera angle but got a slightly tilted side view instead. It seems to prioritize cinematic flair over strict prompt accuracy, which limits creative control.\n\n### 2. Audio doesn’t always work — and it’s not obvious why\n\nBy default, Veo runs in Veo 2 mode, which does not include audio. I only realized this after a few silent clips and some digging. You’ll need to manually switch to \"Experiential Mode\" under the \"Quality\" tab to activate audio and dialogue.\n\nEven then, lip-syncing is inconsistent, and dialogue sometimes drops out altogether, like a badly dubbed foreign film. Additionally, the subtitles are almost always wrong or misspelled.\n\n### 3. Complex scenes throw it off\n\nVeo 3 shines with single-subject clips, but longer or more intricate scenes can fall apart. The narrative gets muddy, and character interactions often feel stiff or repetitive. If you're aiming to create a multi-character, multi-scene story, temper your expectations.... ### 4. The interface still needs polish\n\nThere were moments when the interface felt unintuitive or unstable. I experienced an unexpected session timeout that erased a generated video, and I couldn’t find a recovery option.\n\nAdditionally, when I prompted the model to add dialogue within the scene I got something that did not fit the scenario at all.\n\nFor a tool this powerful, the UX still feels a bit rough around the edges.\n\n### 5. It raises some big ethical questions\n\nVeo’s realism is incredible — and a little unsettling. There’s growing concern that ultra-realistic, AI-generated videos could blur the lines between fact and fiction, especially as this tech becomes more accessible. It also sparks new debates around authorship and originality in creative work.\n\n### Promising but pricey\n\nVeo 3 is a huge step forward in AI video — especially for casual users who want fast, high-quality results. But at $249 per month (with a discounted rate for the first three months), the Google AI Ultra package is a steep price to pay for a tool that still has some notable bugs.\n\nIf you’re just looking to experiment with video generation or create basic promotional content, Veo 3 is exciting — but not yet essential. For professional creators, though, it’s worth watching closely. Just keep your prompts tight, your expectations realistic and your finger ready to re-render.... ### More from Tom's Guide\n\n- This $12.99/month hack gives you access to Google’s Veo 3 AI video tool — here’s how\n\n- Claude Opus 4 is here — and it might be the smartest AI assistant yet\n\n- The only 5 prompt types you need to master ChatGPT (and any other chatbot)\n\nAmanda Caswell is an award-winning journalist, bestselling YA author, and one of today’s leading voices in AI and technology.

But the spread of the videos online is also dismaying many video professionals and lovers of art.\n\n- Some dismiss any AI-generated video as \"slop,\" regardless of its technical proficiency or lifelike qualities — but, as Axios' Ina Fried points out, AI slop is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n- The tool could also be useful for more commercial marketing and media work, AI analyst Ethan Mollick writes.\n\n**It's unclear how Google trained Veo 3 **and how that might affect the creativity of its outputs.\n\n- 404 Media found that Veo 3 generated the same lame dad joke for several users who prompted it to create a video of a man doing stand-up comedy.\n\n- Likewise, last year, YouTuber Marques Brownlee asked Sora to create a video of a \"tech reviewer sitting at a desk.\" The generated video featured a fake plant that's nearly identical to the shrub Brownlee keeps on his desk for many of his videos — suggesting the tool may have been trained on them.\n\n**What we're watching:** As hyperrealistic AI-generated videos become even easier to produce, the world hasn't even begun to sort out how to manage authorship, consent, rights and the film industry's future.\n\n##### Go deeperJul 10, 2025 - Technology... ## Google AI's new trick: Turn any image into a brief video\n\nGoogle's latest AI video tool, Veo 3, now generates short movies with sound based only on still photos and prompts.\n\nGo deeper (1 min. read)\n\n**The big picture: **The feature, released Thursday, is available to Ultra and Pro users on the web and soon on mobile for subscribers in select regions, Google shared with Axios.\n\n## Google avatars shake up workplace video making\n\nGoogle Vids is now providing users of the workplace video creation tool with a set of pre-made avatars for use in brief AI-generated videos, the company said Wednesday.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **The rise of cheap, convenient AI video generation threatens jobs for video producers, editors, camera operators and even commercial actors.\n\n## AI slop is ruining all of our favorite places to scroll\n\nAn AI-generated video of rabbits jumping on a trampoline that went viral this week — and was widely believed to be real — proved even cute animal vids aren't safe from convincing slop machines.\n\nGo deeper (2 min. read)\n\n**Why it matters: **All the fake AI-generated content online is sapping the joy of casual scrolling.",

We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.\n\nToday, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”\n\nWe’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is state-of-the-art and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.\n\n## Refine your narrative with audio and more control\n\nWith Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.\n\nNow, with rich, generated audio, you can:\n\n**Craft the look of your scene.**With \"Ingredients to Video,\" you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned. **Control the shot from start to finish.**Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions. **Create longer, seamless shots.**With \"Extend,\" you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.... ## Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision\n\nGreat ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.\n\n**Add new elements to any scene.**With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural. **Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.**Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.\n\n## Start creating in Flow today\n\nWith more precise editing capabilities, audio across all existing features and higher-quality outputs powered by Veo 3.1, we're opening up new possibilities for richer, more powerful video storytelling right inside Flow.\n\nThe Veo 3.1 model is also available via the Gemini API for developers, Vertex AI for enterprise customers, and the Gemini app. New capabilities are available in both Gemini API\n\n2\n\nand Vertex AI\n\n3",

This is helpful for maintaining character consistency across multiple shots or applying a specific style to your video.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nconfig=types.GenerateVideosConfig(\n\nreference_images=[reference_image1, reference_image2],\n\n),\n\n\n\n```... Your story is no longer limited by the original generation. With Scene extension, you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, by generating new clips that connect to your previous video. Each new video is generated based on the final second of the previous clip. This maintains visual continuity, making the feature ideal for extending shots with background audio.\n\n```\n\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client()\n\noperation = client.models.generate_videos(\n\nmodel=\"veo-3.1-generate-preview\",\n\nprompt=prompt,\n\nvideo=video_to_extend\n\n\n\n```\n\nCreate smooth, natural scenes that bridge two different images.

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

's not very wide How wide are we talking typically maybe four to five meters about 15 feet across which sounds like a lot down here but from hundreds of kilometers up it's\ntiny like trying to spot a piece of {ts:95} thread from uh across a football stadium That's a pretty good analogy Yeah It lacks scale in that dimension compare it to say modern highways Some are wider than the wall or city grids especially at night Right The lights make a huge difference Exactly Cities create this massive area of contrast particularly with the lights The wall uh tends to follow the terrain uses natural colors It just doesn't stand out visually We've heard that directly from astronauts haven't we neil Armstrong I think mentioned it Yep Armstrong Chris Hadfield too Many have said it just blends in It doesn't have that sharp contrast you'd need to pick it out against the mountains or the land So other things are easier to see then Oh\ndefinitely Things like airports those long straight runways really stand out {ts:141} big dams reflecting sunlight even large patterns of farmland you know the geometric shapes Okay so it's about contrast and maybe width or overall sprawl not just length Precisely Scale and contrast are key for naked eye visibility from that altitude The walls amazing length doesn't quite translate into visibility without help So if astronauts say no where did this whole visible from space thing even start it feels like it... 's been around forever Well interestingly it actually started before anyone went to space way back in the 19th century No way How just speculation really Western writers like Richard Hallebertton was one often mentioned later were imagining these grand views\nfrom great heights even from the moon sometimes quite fantastically And the Great Wall being this almost mythical {ts:188} structure already It became the prime candidate for what could you see exactly It captured the imagination It seemed plausible this massive feat of engineering being visible from afar And then I guess the space race happens in the 20th century And the idea just got legs It started popping up in like school textbooks travel guides popular science articles almost stated as fact Was there maybe a bit of uh national pride mixed in there too for China maybe Potentially Yeah It's a powerful image isn't it your nation's greatest landmark being visible from the heavens It certainly wouldn't hurt the wall's symbolic status And did China actively\npromote it or just let the idea run it seems for a while it wasn't really challenged and perhaps was seen as you know a positive thing But then came a {ts:234} really key moment in 2003 Ah right Shenzu 5 Yes China's first astronaut Yang Leewi He went up came back and people asked him directly \"Did you see the Great Wall?\"...  And his answer he said no He couldn't pick it out with the naked eye Wow That must have caused a stir It definitely did It led to a lot of discussion within China and internationally It was a firsthand account from their own astronaut kind of settling the debate or at least shifting it significantly So naked eye definitely not But that doesn't mean it's impossible to see from space right just not without health Correct That's a\ncrucial distinction with technology Yes absolutely high resolution cameras on satellites or astronauts using telephoto lenses from the ISS They can image the wall Okay so you need zoom basically or {ts:285} satellite imagery and good conditions You need clear weather maybe the sun angle creating shadows that help define the structure It's not like you just glance out the window and there it is right it requires specific tech and circumstances Very different from the popular myth of just looking down and spotting it easily Totally different So why does this distinction even matter okay it's a myth We busted it Does it change anything i think it does actually It kind of highlights how easily stories especially really cool ones can take root and become accepted facts even when\nthe evidence isn't there Like fact and feeling get intertwined Yeah something like that The idea of seeing the wall is so appealing It feels like it should be true It makes you wonder what other things we accept You know it... 's a good {ts:328} point And maybe focusing just on the visibility thing distracts from what's truly amazing about the wall I think so You get caught up in can you see it can't you see it and you might miss the incredible history the centuries of labor the stories embedded in those stones the cultures it connected or divided the real significance Exactly Debunking the myth lets us appreciate the wall for its actual historical and cultural weight and maybe appreciate the things we can see from space the city lights the patterns of farming even\nunfortunately things like deforestation We actually got some insight on this from Dr Sarah Lynn a historian who specializes in Chinese architecture Oh interesting What did she say well she echoed that point about the myth's power coming from the wall's symbolic weight {ts:373} Plus like you said that early speculation just filling a vacuum before we had real observations It just sounded right Makes sense But she also stressed that the wall's legacy is so much more than just defense She talked about it being a hub for centuries of innovation incredible human effort Yes But also cultural exchange So not just keeping people out but also facilitating things Yeah Like trade routes communication lines even diplomacy happened along or the wall systems It's a much more\ncomplex picture than just a barrier that really broadens the perspective Fascinating Okay so before we wrap up let... 's do a quick myth versus fact round based on what we've covered Ready let's do it Claim one The Great Wall was built in just one century True or false uh it's definitely false It was built over {ts:418} a huge span more than 2,000 years with the Ming dynasty responsible for a lot of the most famous sections Okay Claim two The wall is a single continuous structure from end to end True or false also false It's more like a system sections of wall fortifications watchtowers sometimes using natural features like mountains And there are gaps not one solid line Got it And claim three the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage site True or false that one is\ntrue Designated back in 1987 for its huge cultural importance Perfect So pulling it all together the main takeaway the Great Wall is undeniably one of humanity's most incredible achievements its scale its history staggering But uh the popular idea about seeing it from space with the naked eye that part's a myth Simple as that But {ts:467} knowing that hopefully lets you appreciate its true story even more Absolutely Understanding the reality doesn't diminish the wall It just clarifies what makes it so significant So we definitely encourage you our listeners to maybe dig a little deeper into the wall's actual history It's way more interesting than just the visibility question For sure And maybe as a final thought think about other... facts you hear repeated often How many might be like this one a compelling story that blends fact and feeling but doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny A good challenge Always worth asking where our information comes from",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).... To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.\n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.... ### Ming Great Wall\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From here, the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There, at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关,\n\n*Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.... *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城,\n\n*Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of\n\n*Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the\n\n*China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Thank you for being part of our cultural journey!... {ts:0} [Music] is the Great Wall of China really\n{ts:13} visible from space. Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

Liwie's observation contradicted the information previously presented in several books, board games and various television contests, to quote a few examples. After Liwie's declarations, the Chinese government asked for his statement to be removed from various reports.\n\nThe problem arose a few months later when the American astronaut Eugene Cernan stated at a conference that according to the news from the European Space Agency (ESA) issued on the last 11^th^ of May, in an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. Various international newspapers rushed to explain that Cernan attributed his colleague Liwie's error to bad atmospheric and/or lighting conditions at the moment of his observation.... In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published together with Cernan's declarations a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another communication from the ESA dated the 19^th^ of May 2004 (no longer available in the ESA's website) acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! The ESA had been warned of its error by Mr. Albert Kisskoy, Pr. Gary Li of the University of the State of California and Dr. Zhimin Man from the Fundan University of Shangai.... After this little uproar it is still unclear for some people whether the myth is true or not. In order to answer this question, it is not necessary to go into Space and look: it suffices to know a little about the human visual system and its limits. Not even the best of human eyes at a simple glace could see the Great Wall of China from Space. The impossibility is due to the limitation of the human eye when it comes to seeing small diffusing objects. The relevant parameter is not the Wall'... s length (about 7300 km), but its width, which is usually less than 6 m. See Figure 1. To illustrate this with a simple example, looking at the Great Wall from a distance of 160 km would be the same as looking at a 2 cm diameter cable from more than half a kilometre away! No matter how good the atmospheric conditions, lighting and contrast are —unless the object was self-illuminated or it reflected the sun as a small mirror— it would be totally impossible to see this cable (or, for similar reasons, the Great Wall) at a simple glance, because the eye would need a visual acuity greater than approximately 20/3, which is 7.7 times the normal visual acuity^1^, and more than three times the maximum acuity reached by a falcon^2^, an eagle^3^, or a human eye^4^. Even an optically perfect human eye^5-7^ would not be able to see the monument for two reasons. First, the sampling due to the finite cone spacing in the central fovea^5-7^ imposes a limit to the visual acuity of 2.3 (about 20/9). In this case, a perfect image of the Great Wall would be about one third the size of a single cone excluding pupil diffraction effects. Second, pupil diffraction effects also limit the human visual acuity to 5 (20/4)^6-8^ (for a 6 mm pupil and a 555 nm wavelength). In other words, the edges of the Wall have a spatial frequency that is about two and a half times higher than the cut-off frequency (189 c/deg) of a perfect human eye with a 6 mm pupil. Nevertheless, according to Westheimer experiments^9^, the minimum angle subtended by a line for it to be seen from the distance is approximately only 2 seconds of arc. Such angle is smaller than the one subtended by the Great Wall when observed from Space. Westherimer... 's results are based on the detection of a black line against a bright background; in this scenario, the black line causes a local dip in the luminance of the image, which makes it possible for the eye to detect it. Such a great local change in luminance also makes the detection of the stars at night possible (if bright enough), as does the reflection of the sun in a small distant mirror (as used in a boat to indicate its position). Therefore, in principle, if the Great Wall reflected the sunlight as a long mirror or it were self-illuminated with high-power lamps it could probably be seen form Space. However, in this hypothetical case, the astronaut would not be seeing the Wall but either the lamps or the sunlight reflection. Moreover, natural sun reflection would be very unlikely due to the type of material it was built with (limestone, clay, granite and brick).\n\nObviously, it would be even less likely to see the Great Wall from the moon, situated at a minimum distance of 350,000 km, because the visual acuity would have to be 17,000 times (!) better than that of the normal human eye (in this case it would amount to seeing the cable from a distance of more than 1000 km). In this sense, if the question was: “Could we see the Great Wall of China at a simple glance from Space?” The answer would also have to be “no”, because an astronaut located on the limit of the atmosphere, about 80 km (50 miles) away, would need a visual acuity of approximately 3.9 (about 20/5) to be able to see it.... As a simple exercise, Google Earth^©^ can be used to see the Wall at lat.=40.48234, lon.=116.180592 if one is close enough to the ground. However, once you are more than 40 miles away, it cannot be seen. This simple experiment does not really answer the question since the visualization of the Wall will depends not only on our vision, but also on the satelite image resolution, our computer screen, etc. Despite this, it can be observed that, at a height of 40 miles, the Wall is not visible but the landing runway of the Yongning Airport, located about 4 miles WNW to the Wall, is. Moreover, if the Great Wall was visible from Space, then, contrary to common claims, it would not be the only visible manmade object since astronauts would also enjoy the view of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and probably their own house in case it is more than 6 m wide and long.\n\nFor some unknown reasons (perhaps marketing-related) this belief is one of the “unscientific walls” that has become popular, imposing a false limit to our vision of the world.... - 1.Oyster C.W.

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

Credit: Canva\n\n“The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure that is visible from space.” As kids, this was one of the most popular statements that made us wonder at the sheer size of this wall. And this statement has stuck around for a long time; in fact from before the first man planted his feet on the moon. In 1754, English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"\n\nBut the answer is simple and this persistent myth has been debunked countless times by astronauts and scientists alike, specifically by those who have actually been to space - NO.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n## The Great Wall Is Not Visible From Space To The Naked Eye\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall is visible from space has captured the public imagination for decades. Its sheer length and historical significance contribute to this misconception. However, the vastness of space and the relatively small size of the wall compared to the Earth make it impossible to see without advanced optical equipment.\n\nEven from the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits relatively close to Earth, the Great Wall is barely distinguishable without high-powered cameras and zoom lenses. Astronauts have consistently reported that other man-made structures, such as large cities or highways, are far more visible from orbit.\n\nThe Great Wall, while impressive in scale, is simply too narrow and blends in too much with its surroundings to be seen by the human eye from the perspective of space.... ## Are Any Other Structures Visible From Space?Yes. While the Great Wall of China is not visible from space, plenty of other human-made structures can be seen from orbit. The Pyramids of Giza, for example, are famously visible from the International Space Station, as photographed during Expedition 32. Some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\n**Mallika Bhagat author**\n\nMallika Bhagat dreams about travelling permanently and writing occasionally.

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Have you ever wondered whether the Great Wall of China is visible from space? In this informative video, we'll explore the facts behind this popular myth and explain what makes the Great Wall so special. We'll start by discussing the length and construction of the Wall, and why its narrow width makes it difficult to see from orbit. We'll also cover how the materials used for building the Wall blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape, making it even harder to spot from space. Additionally, we'll share what astronauts have experienced during their missions and why photographs taken from space often do not show the Wall with the naked eye. \n\nWe'll highlight the cultural and historical importance of the Great Wall as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of China’s ancient civilization. You'll learn about its origins, purpose, and how it continues to attract millions of visitors each year.

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).... To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.\n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.... ### Ming Great Wall\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From here, the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There, at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关,\n\n*Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.... *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城,\n\n*Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of\n\n*Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the\n\n*China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

The current English name evolved from accounts of \"the Chinese wall\" from early modern European travelers. By the nineteenth century, \"the Great Wall of China\" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as \"the Chinese wall\".... When China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.... ### Han Great Wall\n\nHan fortifications start from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu (t 馬迷途, s 马迷途, *Mǎmítú*, l \"horses losing their way\") near Yumen Pass.... The sections of the Great Wall around Beijing, were frequently renovated, and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, as it was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China; foreign dignitaries would be shown this section on visits to the Great Wall. The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated. South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 m (25 ft 7 in) high and 5 m (16 ft 5 in) wide.\n\nOne of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling. There it runs 11 km (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 m (16 ft 5 in to 26 ft 3 in) in height, and 6 m (19 ft 8 in) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 m (16 ft 5 in) across the top. Wangjing Lou (t 望京樓, s 望京楼, *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level.

                "snippet": "Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space? This intriguing question has fascinated many for years, blending the allure of an ancient wonder with the marvels of space exploration. The Great Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Despite its impressive size, the visibility of the Great Wall from space is a more complex issue than it may seem, involving factors like distance, color, lighting, and the capabilities of human vision and technology.... ## Understanding The Visibility Factors\n\nThe question of whether you can see the Great Wall of China from space encompasses several\n\n**visibility factors**. To grasp this better, it’s essential to break down the elements that influence what astronauts can observe from low Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n### Distance from Earth’s Surface\n\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits approximately 240 miles above Earth, have a limited visibility range. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions can obscure smaller structures. While the Great Wall spans vast distances, distinguishing its segments among the varied landscape can be challenging.\n\n### Color and Contrast\n\nThe\n\n**great wall’s color** also plays a vital role in its visibility from space. Constructed primarily with earth and stone materials that blend well with the surrounding terrain, the wall often camouflages against the landscape. Unlike brighter man-made structures or urban areas, the wall’s earthy tones diminish its prominence in photographs taken from space.... ### Weather and Atmospheric Conditions\n\nWeather conditions can significantly affect visibility. Clear skies are essential for remarkable space views. Clouds, rain, and atmospheric haze can obscure the wall and other ground features. Additionally, light plays a critical role; during sunset or sunrise, shadows can help highlight or obscure the wall’s structure.... ## Astronaut Accounts and Visual Confirmation\n\nThough many astronauts have reported seeing landmarks from space, specific references to the Great Wall are rare. According to various accounts, while some astronauts have claimed glimpses of the Great Wall, they describe it as extremely thin and indistinct, often blending in with the natural landscape.\n\n### Notable Astronaut Quotes\n\n**Chris Hadfield**, a Canadian astronaut, mentioned in interviews and on social media platforms that, while you can see some features of the Great Wall, identifying it without prior knowledge is extremely difficult. **Andrew R. Morgan**, another astronaut, noted that various extensions of the wall are challenging to distinguish from other geographical features.\n\nThese statements reflect a common sentiment among astronauts: while the Great Wall is a remarkable structure on Earth, its visibility from space isn’t what most people might expect.... ## Technological Advancements in Satellite Imaging\n\nAs technology has evolved, so have the capabilities of satellite imaging. Modern satellites can capture high-resolution images of Earth, allowing scientists and researchers to study the Great Wall from beyond the atmosphere.... ### Satellite Imagery and Mapping\n\nSeveral satellites equipped with sophisticated sensors can detect structures on Earth’s surface. These images often highlight changes in land use, urban sprawl, and historical sites like the Great Wall. However, the technical capability to ‘see’ the wall does not equate to simple visibility by the naked eye.\n\n\n\n**Satellite** | **Capabilities** | **Purpose** |... |————————-|———————————————————|——————————————————–|\n| Landsat (NASA) | Medium-resolution images (30m pixels) | Earth observation, environmental observation |\n| WorldView-3 | High-resolution images (31cm pixels) | Urban planning, disaster response |\n| SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) | High-resolution and multispectral images | Agricultural monitoring, forestry management |\nModern satellites, like WorldView-3, possess extremely high-resolution imaging capabilities, allowing researchers to identify natural and artificial structures—including the Great Wall—more clearly. This advancement raises the question of technological versus physical visibility.... ## The Great Wall and Global Awareness\n\nThe Great Wall of China serves as a symbol of cultural pride and historical significance. Its immense scale is part of its charm and enduring fascination.\n\n**Understanding the wall’s impact** on global culture and tourism reveals why seeing it from space, while challenging, is still a significant inquiry.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nConstructed over several dynasties, the\n\n**Great Wall’s purpose** was multifold. Primarily built for defense, it also played a key role in facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors annually. Its preservation and restoration have become vital issues, ensuring this architectural marvel remains part of human heritage.\n\n### Tourism and Global Studies\n\nTourism is a significant aspect of the Great Wall’s legacy. Millions visit every year to walk its lengths and experience its history.

                "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

The show where we take the persistent myths, urban legends and common misconceptions and\nput them to the ultimate test.\n{ts:31} Is it a proven fact? Or just a load of... well, you know.\n{ts:37} I'm your host and in each episode we'll dive deep into one of these widely believed ideas\nto see if it holds up under scrutiny. Prepare to have your mind blown or at least... slightly adjusted.\n{ts:55} For our very first episode, we're tackling a big one. A myth so pervasive, so grand, it stretches across continents. Well, metaphorically speaking, we're talking about the claim that the Great Wall of China\nis the only man-made structure visible from space.\n{ts:79} You've heard it right, it's practically etched into our collective consciousness. From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted.

Liwie's observation contradicted the information previously presented in several books, board games and various television contests, to quote a few examples. After Liwie's declarations, the Chinese government asked for his statement to be removed from various reports.\n\nThe problem arose a few months later when the American astronaut Eugene Cernan stated at a conference that according to the news from the European Space Agency (ESA) issued on the last 11^th^ of May, in an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. Various international newspapers rushed to explain that Cernan attributed his colleague Liwie's error to bad atmospheric and/or lighting conditions at the moment of his observation.... In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published together with Cernan's declarations a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another communication from the ESA dated the 19^th^ of May 2004 (no longer available in the ESA's website) acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! The ESA had been warned of its error by Mr. Albert Kisskoy, Pr. Gary Li of the University of the State of California and Dr. Zhimin Man from the Fundan University of Shangai.... After this little uproar it is still unclear for some people whether the myth is true or not. In order to answer this question, it is not necessary to go into Space and look: it suffices to know a little about the human visual system and its limits. Not even the best of human eyes at a simple glace could see the Great Wall of China from Space. The impossibility is due to the limitation of the human eye when it comes to seeing small diffusing objects. The relevant parameter is not the Wall'... s length (about 7300 km), but its width, which is usually less than 6 m. See Figure 1. To illustrate this with a simple example, looking at the Great Wall from a distance of 160 km would be the same as looking at a 2 cm diameter cable from more than half a kilometre away! No matter how good the atmospheric conditions, lighting and contrast are —unless the object was self-illuminated or it reflected the sun as a small mirror— it would be totally impossible to see this cable (or, for similar reasons, the Great Wall) at a simple glance, because the eye would need a visual acuity greater than approximately 20/3, which is 7.7 times the normal visual acuity^1^, and more than three times the maximum acuity reached by a falcon^2^, an eagle^3^, or a human eye^4^. Even an optically perfect human eye^5-7^ would not be able to see the monument for two reasons. First, the sampling due to the finite cone spacing in the central fovea^5-7^ imposes a limit to the visual acuity of 2.3 (about 20/9). In this case, a perfect image of the Great Wall would be about one third the size of a single cone excluding pupil diffraction effects. Second, pupil diffraction effects also limit the human visual acuity to 5 (20/4)^6-8^ (for a 6 mm pupil and a 555 nm wavelength). In other words, the edges of the Wall have a spatial frequency that is about two and a half times higher than the cut-off frequency (189 c/deg) of a perfect human eye with a 6 mm pupil. Nevertheless, according to Westheimer experiments^9^, the minimum angle subtended by a line for it to be seen from the distance is approximately only 2 seconds of arc. Such angle is smaller than the one subtended by the Great Wall when observed from Space. Westherimer... 's results are based on the detection of a black line against a bright background; in this scenario, the black line causes a local dip in the luminance of the image, which makes it possible for the eye to detect it. Such a great local change in luminance also makes the detection of the stars at night possible (if bright enough), as does the reflection of the sun in a small distant mirror (as used in a boat to indicate its position). Therefore, in principle, if the Great Wall reflected the sunlight as a long mirror or it were self-illuminated with high-power lamps it could probably be seen form Space. However, in this hypothetical case, the astronaut would not be seeing the Wall but either the lamps or the sunlight reflection. Moreover, natural sun reflection would be very unlikely due to the type of material it was built with (limestone, clay, granite and brick).\n\nObviously, it would be even less likely to see the Great Wall from the moon, situated at a minimum distance of 350,000 km, because the visual acuity would have to be 17,000 times (!) better than that of the normal human eye (in this case it would amount to seeing the cable from a distance of more than 1000 km). In this sense, if the question was: “Could we see the Great Wall of China at a simple glance from Space?” The answer would also have to be “no”, because an astronaut located on the limit of the atmosphere, about 80 km (50 miles) away, would need a visual acuity of approximately 3.9 (about 20/5) to be able to see it.... As a simple exercise, Google Earth^©^ can be used to see the Wall at lat.=40.48234, lon.=116.180592 if one is close enough to the ground. However, once you are more than 40 miles away, it cannot be seen. This simple experiment does not really answer the question since the visualization of the Wall will depends not only on our vision, but also on the satelite image resolution, our computer screen, etc. Despite this, it can be observed that, at a height of 40 miles, the Wall is not visible but the landing runway of the Yongning Airport, located about 4 miles WNW to the Wall, is. Moreover, if the Great Wall was visible from Space, then, contrary to common claims, it would not be the only visible manmade object since astronauts would also enjoy the view of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and probably their own house in case it is more than 6 m wide and long.\n\nFor some unknown reasons (perhaps marketing-related) this belief is one of the “unscientific walls” that has become popular, imposing a false limit to our vision of the world.... - 1.Oyster C.W.

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it.

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

                "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "# The Great Wall of China is Visible from Space: A Fact-Check\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe claim that \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space\" has persisted for decades, often cited as a testament to the wall's immense scale. This assertion has been popularized in various forms, including the notion that it is the only man-made structure visible from the Moon. However, the validity of this claim has been scrutinized by experts and scientists. This article explores the evidence surrounding this claim and examines the reliability of the sources that discuss it.\n\n## What We Know\n\n\n\n**Visibility from Space**: The consensus among experts is that the Great Wall of China is not easily visible from space with the naked eye. A 2010 article published in *PMC*states that even the best human eyes cannot see the wall from space due to its narrowness and the surrounding landscape 1.\n\n\n\n**Astronaut Accounts**: Astronauts have reported that the wall is difficult to see from low Earth orbit. For instance, Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, stated that he could not see the wall during his mission in 2003 5.\n\n\n\n**NASA's Position**: NASA has produced images of the Great Wall taken from the International Space Station (ISS), but these images require photographic equipment to capture the structure clearly, indicating that it is not visible to the naked eye 2.\n\n\n\n**Myth Origins**: The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon likely originated from a 1932 cartoon published by Ripley's Believe It or Not! 10. This myth has persisted despite a lack of evidence supporting it.\n\n\n\n**Pollution and Coloration**: Factors such as pollution and the wall's coloration make it even less visible from space. According to *Scientific American*, the wall blends into its surroundings, making it challenging to distinguish from the landscape 6.... ## Analysis\n\nThe sources discussing the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space vary in their credibility and potential biases:\n\n\n\n**Scientific and Academic Sources**: Articles from *Scientific American*and *PMC*provide scientifically grounded perspectives. They rely on expert opinions and empirical evidence, making them reliable for understanding the limitations of human vision and the challenges of visibility from space 16.\n\n\n\n**NASA**: As a leading authority in space exploration, NASA's images and statements carry significant weight. Their documentation of the Great Wall, while visually impressive, reinforces the idea that visibility is not feasible without specialized equipment 2.\n\n\n\n**Popular Media**: Sources like *Snopes*and *Britannica*offer fact-checking perspectives that clarify the myth's origins and its perpetuation over time. They emphasize the distinction between popular belief and scientific reality 38.\n\n\n\n**Potential Bias**: Some sources, such as *Times Now News*and *Jagran Josh*, may have a more sensationalist approach, focusing on the myth's cultural significance rather than providing a rigorous scientific analysis 49. This could lead to a skewed representation of the facts.\n\n\n\n**Methodological Concerns**: While many sources cite astronaut accounts and scientific studies, the methodology behind these claims is not always transparent. For example, how visibility was assessed or the specific conditions under which observations were made are often not detailed.... ## Conclusion\n\n**Verdict: False**\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is false. Key evidence supporting this conclusion includes expert consensus indicating that the wall is too narrow and blends into its surroundings, making it nearly impossible to see with the naked eye from space. Astronaut accounts, including those from Yang Liwei, further corroborate this, as they have reported difficulty in spotting the wall even from low Earth orbit. Additionally, NASA's imagery demonstrates that specialized photographic equipment is necessary to capture the wall clearly, reinforcing the assertion that it is not visible without aid.\n\nIt is important to note that while the myth of the Great Wall's visibility has cultural significance and has been popularized over time, it lacks scientific support. The origins of this myth can be traced back to a 1932 cartoon, which highlights how misinformation can persist despite a lack of evidence.\n\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations in the available evidence. Visibility can depend on various factors, including atmospheric conditions and the observer's location. Thus, while the consensus is clear, there may be specific scenarios where visibility could be marginally improved, though this does not substantiate the claim as a general truth.\n\nReaders are encouraged to critically evaluate information and consider the sources and evidence behind claims, especially those that have become entrenched in popular belief.... ## Sources\n\n- López-Gil, N.

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

From textbook to casual conversation, this idea pops up everywhere. The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted. What other myths do you want us to tackle?

's not very wide How wide are we talking typically maybe four to five meters about 15 feet across which sounds like a lot down here but from hundreds of kilometers up it's\ntiny like trying to spot a piece of {ts:95} thread from uh across a football stadium That's a pretty good analogy Yeah It lacks scale in that dimension compare it to say modern highways Some are wider than the wall or city grids especially at night Right The lights make a huge difference Exactly Cities create this massive area of contrast particularly with the lights The wall uh tends to follow the terrain uses natural colors It just doesn't stand out visually We've heard that directly from astronauts haven't we neil Armstrong I think mentioned it Yep Armstrong Chris Hadfield too Many have said it just blends in It doesn't have that sharp contrast you'd need to pick it out against the mountains or the land So other things are easier to see then Oh\ndefinitely Things like airports those long straight runways really stand out {ts:141} big dams reflecting sunlight even large patterns of farmland you know the geometric shapes Okay so it's about contrast and maybe width or overall sprawl not just length Precisely Scale and contrast are key for naked eye visibility from that altitude The walls amazing length doesn't quite translate into visibility without help So if astronauts say no where did this whole visible from space thing even start it feels like it... 's been around forever Well interestingly it actually started before anyone went to space way back in the 19th century No way How just speculation really Western writers like Richard Hallebertton was one often mentioned later were imagining these grand views\nfrom great heights even from the moon sometimes quite fantastically And the Great Wall being this almost mythical {ts:188} structure already It became the prime candidate for what could you see exactly It captured the imagination It seemed plausible this massive feat of engineering being visible from afar And then I guess the space race happens in the 20th century And the idea just got legs It started popping up in like school textbooks travel guides popular science articles almost stated as fact Was there maybe a bit of uh national pride mixed in there too for China maybe Potentially Yeah It's a powerful image isn't it your nation's greatest landmark being visible from the heavens It certainly wouldn't hurt the wall's symbolic status And did China actively\npromote it or just let the idea run it seems for a while it wasn't really challenged and perhaps was seen as you know a positive thing But then came a {ts:234} really key moment in 2003 Ah right Shenzu 5 Yes China's first astronaut Yang Leewi He went up came back and people asked him directly \"Did you see the Great Wall?\"...  And his answer he said no He couldn't pick it out with the naked eye Wow That must have caused a stir It definitely did It led to a lot of discussion within China and internationally It was a firsthand account from their own astronaut kind of settling the debate or at least shifting it significantly So naked eye definitely not But that doesn't mean it's impossible to see from space right just not without health Correct That's a\ncrucial distinction with technology Yes absolutely high resolution cameras on satellites or astronauts using telephoto lenses from the ISS They can image the wall Okay so you need zoom basically or {ts:285} satellite imagery and good conditions You need clear weather maybe the sun angle creating shadows that help define the structure It's not like you just glance out the window and there it is right it requires specific tech and circumstances Very different from the popular myth of just looking down and spotting it easily Totally different So why does this distinction even matter okay it's a myth We busted it Does it change anything i think it does actually It kind of highlights how easily stories especially really cool ones can take root and become accepted facts even when\nthe evidence isn't there Like fact and feeling get intertwined Yeah something like that The idea of seeing the wall is so appealing It feels like it should be true It makes you wonder what other things we accept You know it... 's a good {ts:328} point And maybe focusing just on the visibility thing distracts from what's truly amazing about the wall I think so You get caught up in can you see it can't you see it and you might miss the incredible history the centuries of labor the stories embedded in those stones the cultures it connected or divided the real significance Exactly Debunking the myth lets us appreciate the wall for its actual historical and cultural weight and maybe appreciate the things we can see from space the city lights the patterns of farming even\nunfortunately things like deforestation We actually got some insight on this from Dr Sarah Lynn a historian who specializes in Chinese architecture Oh interesting What did she say well she echoed that point about the myth's power coming from the wall's symbolic weight {ts:373} Plus like you said that early speculation just filling a vacuum before we had real observations It just sounded right Makes sense But she also stressed that the wall's legacy is so much more than just defense She talked about it being a hub for centuries of innovation incredible human effort Yes But also cultural exchange So not just keeping people out but also facilitating things Yeah Like trade routes communication lines even diplomacy happened along or the wall systems It's a much more\ncomplex picture than just a barrier that really broadens the perspective Fascinating Okay so before we wrap up let... 's do a quick myth versus fact round based on what we've covered Ready let's do it Claim one The Great Wall was built in just one century True or false uh it's definitely false It was built over {ts:418} a huge span more than 2,000 years with the Ming dynasty responsible for a lot of the most famous sections Okay Claim two The wall is a single continuous structure from end to end True or false also false It's more like a system sections of wall fortifications watchtowers sometimes using natural features like mountains And there are gaps not one solid line Got it And claim three the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage site True or false that one is\ntrue Designated back in 1987 for its huge cultural importance Perfect So pulling it all together the main takeaway the Great Wall is undeniably one of humanity's most incredible achievements its scale its history staggering But uh the popular idea about seeing it from space with the naked eye that part's a myth Simple as that But {ts:467} knowing that hopefully lets you appreciate its true story even more Absolutely Understanding the reality doesn't diminish the wall It just clarifies what makes it so significant So we definitely encourage you our listeners to maybe dig a little deeper into the wall's actual history It's way more interesting than just the visibility question For sure And maybe as a final thought think about other... facts you hear repeated often How many might be like this one a compelling story that blends fact and feeling but doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny A good challenge Always worth asking where our information comes from",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

These spaceborne radar images show a segment of the Great Wall of China in a desert region of north-central China, about 700 kilometers (434 miles) west of Beijing. The wall appears as a thin orange band, running from the top to the bottom of the color image on the left. The black and white images on the right correspond to the area outlined by the box and represent the four radar channels of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C). Each channel is sensitive to different aspects of the terrain, including two generations of the Great Wall. The L-band image (24 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted and horizontally received polarizations) provides the clearest image of the two wall segments. The bright continuous line running from top to bottom in this image is the younger wall, built during the Ming Dynasty about 600 years ago. Immediately to the right of this wall is a bright discontinuous line that is the remnant of an older version of the wall, built during the Sui Dynasty, about 1500 years ago.... The two generations of the wall are seen less distinctly in the L-band image (horizontally transmitted, vertically received) and C-band image (6 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted, horizontally received). Orchards and other trees lining a road parallel to the wall show up as bright rectangles on the these two images because the L and C channels are sensitive to complex vegetation structure. The Ming Dynasty wall is between 5 meters and 8 meters high (16 feet to 26 feet) in these areas. The entire wall is about 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) long, but only a 75-kilometer (45.5-mile) long segment is shown in this image. The wall is easily detected from space by radar because its steep, smooth sides provide a prominent surface for reflection of the radar beam. Detection of the remnant Sui Dynasty wall by radar is allowing Chinese researchers to trace the former location of the wall across vast and remote areas. In some areas, the Sui wall is buried by sand that has been blown across the desert.... The images were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 10, 1994. The left image is centered at 37.7 degrees north latitude and 107.5 degrees east longitude. North is toward the upper right. The left image shows an area 25 kilometers by 75 kilometers (15.5 miles by 45.5 miles), and the right images show an area 3.1 kilometers by 2.2 kilometers (1.9 miles by 1.4 miles). The colors in the left image are assigned to different frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L- band, horizontally transmitted, horizontally received; green is L-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received; blue is C-band, horizontally transmitted, vertically received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program.\n\nNASA JPL\n\nPublished October 4, 1994\n\nData acquired October 4, 1994",

The sheer scale of the wall, the incredible human effort involved, it just feels like it\nshould be true.\n{ts:95} It's a testament to human ingenuity, a beacon visible from orbit. But is it? Can you really look out of the International Space Station or even further afield and pick\nout the Great Wall with the naked eye?... {ts:115} Or is this another one of those impressive sounding ideas that just doesn't hold up to the\ncold hard facts of... well, space? Let's break this down.\n{ts:130} First, what do we mean by space? If we're talking about the low Earth orbit, say around 400 kilometres up where the\nInternational Space Station orbits, then technically, yes, you can see some human-made structures, cities, major road networks at night, even very large dams, but the key is\nvisibility with the naked eye.\n{ts:160} the Great Wall, well incredibly long, is actually quite thin. On average it's only around 6 to 9 metres wide and much of it is built from local\nmaterials, meaning its colour often blends in with the surrounding terrain. Think about it, a thin winding, often earth coloured line viewed from hundreds of\nkilometres up.\n{ts:183} It's like trying to spot a single strand of hair on a football field. the top of the Empire State Building. Don't just take my word for it.\n{ts:197} Astronauts themselves have weighed in on this. Many, including those who have spent extensive time aboard the ISS, have stated that while\nit... 's theoretically possible to spot parts of the wall under very specific, ideal conditions, like snow cover contrasting with the surroundings, it's incredibly difficult\nand certainly not a clear, unmistakable landmark.\n{ts:230} In fact, what astronauts can clearly see from space are things like major highways,\nairports and most prominently the bright lights of cities at night. These man-made structures create a much stronger visual signature against the Earth's\nsurface. So, after careful consideration, expert testimony and a little bit of common sense, the\nmyth that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space is\n{ts:263} officially busted. an amazing feat of engineering, no doubt, but it's visibility from space is greatly\nexaggerated. It just goes to show you that even the most widely accepted facts can sometimes be nothing\nmore than persistent myths.\n{ts:286} That's it for episode 1 of True or Busted. What other myths do you want us to tackle? Let us know in the comments below.\n{ts:293} Don't forget to like this video, subscribe to the channel and hit that notification bell\nso you don't miss our next myth-busting adventure.

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

A popular myth, the claim was disproved when astronauts stated that the Great Wall of China was not visible with the naked eye from the Moon. Due to its coloration and pollution, the structure is only sometimes visible from low orbit and the International Space Station.\n\n#### Related Questions\n- Why was the Great Wall of China built?\n- What are the major ethnic groups in China?",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

Liwie's observation contradicted the information previously presented in several books, board games and various television contests, to quote a few examples. After Liwie's declarations, the Chinese government asked for his statement to be removed from various reports.\n\nThe problem arose a few months later when the American astronaut Eugene Cernan stated at a conference that according to the news from the European Space Agency (ESA) issued on the last 11^th^ of May, in an orbit between 160 and 320 km, the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye. Various international newspapers rushed to explain that Cernan attributed his colleague Liwie's error to bad atmospheric and/or lighting conditions at the moment of his observation.... In an attempt to further clarify things, the ESA published together with Cernan's declarations a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another communication from the ESA dated the 19^th^ of May 2004 (no longer available in the ESA's website) acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! The ESA had been warned of its error by Mr. Albert Kisskoy, Pr. Gary Li of the University of the State of California and Dr. Zhimin Man from the Fundan University of Shangai.... After this little uproar it is still unclear for some people whether the myth is true or not. In order to answer this question, it is not necessary to go into Space and look: it suffices to know a little about the human visual system and its limits. Not even the best of human eyes at a simple glace could see the Great Wall of China from Space. The impossibility is due to the limitation of the human eye when it comes to seeing small diffusing objects. The relevant parameter is not the Wall'... s length (about 7300 km), but its width, which is usually less than 6 m. See Figure 1. To illustrate this with a simple example, looking at the Great Wall from a distance of 160 km would be the same as looking at a 2 cm diameter cable from more than half a kilometre away! No matter how good the atmospheric conditions, lighting and contrast are —unless the object was self-illuminated or it reflected the sun as a small mirror— it would be totally impossible to see this cable (or, for similar reasons, the Great Wall) at a simple glance, because the eye would need a visual acuity greater than approximately 20/3, which is 7.7 times the normal visual acuity^1^, and more than three times the maximum acuity reached by a falcon^2^, an eagle^3^, or a human eye^4^. Even an optically perfect human eye^5-7^ would not be able to see the monument for two reasons. First, the sampling due to the finite cone spacing in the central fovea^5-7^ imposes a limit to the visual acuity of 2.3 (about 20/9). In this case, a perfect image of the Great Wall would be about one third the size of a single cone excluding pupil diffraction effects. Second, pupil diffraction effects also limit the human visual acuity to 5 (20/4)^6-8^ (for a 6 mm pupil and a 555 nm wavelength). In other words, the edges of the Wall have a spatial frequency that is about two and a half times higher than the cut-off frequency (189 c/deg) of a perfect human eye with a 6 mm pupil. Nevertheless, according to Westheimer experiments^9^, the minimum angle subtended by a line for it to be seen from the distance is approximately only 2 seconds of arc. Such angle is smaller than the one subtended by the Great Wall when observed from Space. Westherimer... 's results are based on the detection of a black line against a bright background; in this scenario, the black line causes a local dip in the luminance of the image, which makes it possible for the eye to detect it. Such a great local change in luminance also makes the detection of the stars at night possible (if bright enough), as does the reflection of the sun in a small distant mirror (as used in a boat to indicate its position). Therefore, in principle, if the Great Wall reflected the sunlight as a long mirror or it were self-illuminated with high-power lamps it could probably be seen form Space. However, in this hypothetical case, the astronaut would not be seeing the Wall but either the lamps or the sunlight reflection. Moreover, natural sun reflection would be very unlikely due to the type of material it was built with (limestone, clay, granite and brick).\n\nObviously, it would be even less likely to see the Great Wall from the moon, situated at a minimum distance of 350,000 km, because the visual acuity would have to be 17,000 times (!) better than that of the normal human eye (in this case it would amount to seeing the cable from a distance of more than 1000 km). In this sense, if the question was: “Could we see the Great Wall of China at a simple glance from Space?” The answer would also have to be “no”, because an astronaut located on the limit of the atmosphere, about 80 km (50 miles) away, would need a visual acuity of approximately 3.9 (about 20/5) to be able to see it.... As a simple exercise, Google Earth^©^ can be used to see the Wall at lat.=40.48234, lon.=116.180592 if one is close enough to the ground. However, once you are more than 40 miles away, it cannot be seen. This simple experiment does not really answer the question since the visualization of the Wall will depends not only on our vision, but also on the satelite image resolution, our computer screen, etc. Despite this, it can be observed that, at a height of 40 miles, the Wall is not visible but the landing runway of the Yongning Airport, located about 4 miles WNW to the Wall, is. Moreover, if the Great Wall was visible from Space, then, contrary to common claims, it would not be the only visible manmade object since astronauts would also enjoy the view of the Pyramids of Egypt, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and probably their own house in case it is more than 6 m wide and long.\n\nFor some unknown reasons (perhaps marketing-related) this belief is one of the “unscientific walls” that has become popular, imposing a false limit to our vision of the world.... - 1.Oyster C.W.

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China is an iconic landmark and an impressive engineering feat, but is it visible from space? This is a question that has been debated for decades. Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it. The wall continues to stand as a testament to China",

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).... To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.\n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.... ### Ming Great Wall\n\nThe Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall. From here, the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There, at Piantou Pass (t 偏頭關, s 偏头关,\n\n*Piāntóuguān*) in Xinzhou, Shanxi, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t 外長城, s 外长城, *Wài Chǎngchéng*) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t 內長城, s 內长城, *Nèi Chǎngchéng*) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400 km (250 mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (四海冶, *Sìhǎiyě*), in Beijing's Yanqing County.... *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level. Southeast of Jinshanling is the Mutianyu Great Wall which winds along lofty, cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for 2.25 km (1.40 mi). It is connected with Juyongguan Pass to the west and Gubeikou to the east. This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nAt the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"First Pass Under Heaven\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"Old Dragon Head\". 3 km (2 mi) north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (t 焦山長城, s 焦山长城,\n\n*Jiāoshān Chángchéng*), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall. 15 km (9 mi) northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou (t 九門口, s 九门口, *Jiǔménkǒu*), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge.\n\nIn 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the Ming wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015, nine sections with a total length of more than 10 km (6 mi), believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.... ## Condition\n\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads. Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Cultural Heritage Administration states that 22% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared, while 1,961 km (1,219 mi) of wall have vanished. In 2007 it was estimated that more than 60 km (37 mi) of the wall in Gansu province may disappear in the next 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms. In some places, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 5 m (16 ft 5 in) to less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared. Many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than brick and stone, and thus are more susceptible to erosion. In 2014 a portion of the wall near the border of Liaoning and Hebei province was repaired with concrete. The work has been much criticized.\n\nA section of the wall in Shanxi province was severely damaged in 2023 by construction workers, who widened an existing gap in the wall to make a shortcut for an excavator to pass through. Police described the act as causing \"irreversible damage to the integrity of the Ming Great Wall and to the safety of the cultural relics\".... ## Visibility from space\n\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n### From the Moon\n\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon. Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, it is still ingrained in popular culture. The apparent width of the Great Wall as seen from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away.\n\nOne of the earliest known references to the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from the Moon appears in a letter written in 1754 by the English antiquary William Stukeley. Stukeley wrote that, \"This mighty wall [Hadrian's wall] of four score miles [130 km] in length is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\" The claim was also mentioned by Henry Norman in 1895, writing \"besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the Moon.\" The myth also appears in the 1932 strip of\n\n*Ripley's Believe It or Not!.*\n\n### From low Earth orbit\n\nThe Great Wall has also been claimed to be visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude extending from 160 km (100 mi)). NASA states that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.\n\nAstronauts testifying to its visibility from space include Gene Cernan and Ed Lu; Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, meanwhile stated that he had not been able to see it. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting of its visibility from an altitude of 160 and 320 km (100 and 200 mi); the image was actually of a river in Beijing.\n\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the\n\n*China Daily* later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.",

The current English name evolved from accounts of \"the Chinese wall\" from early modern European travelers. By the nineteenth century, \"the Great Wall of China\" had become standard in English and French, although other European languages such as German continue to refer to it as \"the Chinese wall\".... When China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.... ### Han Great Wall\n\nHan fortifications start from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province. Ruins of the remotest Han border posts are found in Mamitu (t 馬迷途, s 马迷途, *Mǎmítú*, l \"horses losing their way\") near Yumen Pass.... The sections of the Great Wall around Beijing, were frequently renovated, and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, as it was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China; foreign dignitaries would be shown this section on visits to the Great Wall. The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated. South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8 m (25 ft 7 in) high and 5 m (16 ft 5 in) wide.\n\nOne of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling. There it runs 11 km (7 mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8 m (16 ft 5 in to 26 ft 3 in) in height, and 6 m (19 ft 8 in) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5 m (16 ft 5 in) across the top. Wangjing Lou (t 望京樓, s 望京楼, *Wàngjīng Lóu*) is one of Jinshanling's 67 watchtowers, 980 m (3,220 ft) above sea level.

                "snippet": "Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space? This intriguing question has fascinated many for years, blending the allure of an ancient wonder with the marvels of space exploration. The Great Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World, stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Despite its impressive size, the visibility of the Great Wall from space is a more complex issue than it may seem, involving factors like distance, color, lighting, and the capabilities of human vision and technology.... ## Understanding The Visibility Factors\n\nThe question of whether you can see the Great Wall of China from space encompasses several\n\n**visibility factors**. To grasp this better, it’s essential to break down the elements that influence what astronauts can observe from low Earth orbit and beyond.\n\n### Distance from Earth’s Surface\n\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits approximately 240 miles above Earth, have a limited visibility range. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions can obscure smaller structures. While the Great Wall spans vast distances, distinguishing its segments among the varied landscape can be challenging.\n\n### Color and Contrast\n\nThe\n\n**great wall’s color** also plays a vital role in its visibility from space. Constructed primarily with earth and stone materials that blend well with the surrounding terrain, the wall often camouflages against the landscape. Unlike brighter man-made structures or urban areas, the wall’s earthy tones diminish its prominence in photographs taken from space.... ### Weather and Atmospheric Conditions\n\nWeather conditions can significantly affect visibility. Clear skies are essential for remarkable space views. Clouds, rain, and atmospheric haze can obscure the wall and other ground features. Additionally, light plays a critical role; during sunset or sunrise, shadows can help highlight or obscure the wall’s structure.... ## Astronaut Accounts and Visual Confirmation\n\nThough many astronauts have reported seeing landmarks from space, specific references to the Great Wall are rare. According to various accounts, while some astronauts have claimed glimpses of the Great Wall, they describe it as extremely thin and indistinct, often blending in with the natural landscape.\n\n### Notable Astronaut Quotes\n\n**Chris Hadfield**, a Canadian astronaut, mentioned in interviews and on social media platforms that, while you can see some features of the Great Wall, identifying it without prior knowledge is extremely difficult. **Andrew R. Morgan**, another astronaut, noted that various extensions of the wall are challenging to distinguish from other geographical features.\n\nThese statements reflect a common sentiment among astronauts: while the Great Wall is a remarkable structure on Earth, its visibility from space isn’t what most people might expect.... ## Technological Advancements in Satellite Imaging\n\nAs technology has evolved, so have the capabilities of satellite imaging. Modern satellites can capture high-resolution images of Earth, allowing scientists and researchers to study the Great Wall from beyond the atmosphere.... ### Satellite Imagery and Mapping\n\nSeveral satellites equipped with sophisticated sensors can detect structures on Earth’s surface. These images often highlight changes in land use, urban sprawl, and historical sites like the Great Wall. However, the technical capability to ‘see’ the wall does not equate to simple visibility by the naked eye.\n\n\n\n**Satellite** | **Capabilities** | **Purpose** |... |————————-|———————————————————|——————————————————–|\n| Landsat (NASA) | Medium-resolution images (30m pixels) | Earth observation, environmental observation |\n| WorldView-3 | High-resolution images (31cm pixels) | Urban planning, disaster response |\n| SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) | High-resolution and multispectral images | Agricultural monitoring, forestry management |\nModern satellites, like WorldView-3, possess extremely high-resolution imaging capabilities, allowing researchers to identify natural and artificial structures—including the Great Wall—more clearly. This advancement raises the question of technological versus physical visibility.... ## The Great Wall and Global Awareness\n\nThe Great Wall of China serves as a symbol of cultural pride and historical significance. Its immense scale is part of its charm and enduring fascination.\n\n**Understanding the wall’s impact** on global culture and tourism reveals why seeing it from space, while challenging, is still a significant inquiry.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nConstructed over several dynasties, the\n\n**Great Wall’s purpose** was multifold. Primarily built for defense, it also played a key role in facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors annually. Its preservation and restoration have become vital issues, ensuring this architectural marvel remains part of human heritage.\n\n### Tourism and Global Studies\n\nTourism is a significant aspect of the Great Wall’s legacy. Millions visit every year to walk its lengths and experience its history. From a global perspective, the Great Wall also becomes a subject of study for environmental scientists and historians examining its interactions with modern development and climate change.... ## Conclusion: The Reality of Visibility\n\nthe inquiry of\n\n**Can You See The Great Wall Of China From Space?** has nuanced answers. While certain **high-resolution satellite images** can identify aspects of the wall, visually locating it from the **International Space Station** proves to be intricate due to various factors such as distance, color blending, and atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe Great Wall continues to inspire awe and curiosity, serving not only as a monumental structure but also as a rich part of cultural heritage that invites exploration, understanding, and preservation. For those intrigued by the complexities of visibility from space and the wonders of our planet, the Great Wall stands as a testament to human ingenuity, offering further avenues for exploration—be it from above or on foot along its storied paths.\n\nFor further detailed observations and scientific insights on satellite imaging technologies, view more at NASA Satellite Imagery Science and to explore global cultural heritage, visit UNESCO’s Great Wall Page.",

This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

                "snippet": "When it comes to spaceflight and astronomy, many myths abound, one of the biggest being the idea that you can see the Great Wall of China from space.\n\nFor example, there are plenty of strange things astronomers used to believe about the Moon.\n\nOne space-based myth that we all have heard is the idea the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure that can be seen from space.\n\n**More Earth from space**\n\nSome people once believed that the Great Wall of China was so big, it could be seen from the surface of the Moon.\n\nSurely, given the International Space Station's position in low-Earth orbit, astronauts living and working onboard the ISS would be the perfect candidates to prove or disprove whether the Great Wall of China can be seen with the naked eye from space.\n\nThe truth is that the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space. To be more precise, it can't easily be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe myth existed long before the Space Age; long before Yuri Gagarin's famous flight to become the first human in space, and long before the Apollo missions to the Moon.\n\nIn fact, as early as 1754 the famed English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"... Perhaps much of the presumption surrounding the Great Wall of China's visibility from the Moon came from 19th century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of Mars, during which he observed what he called \"canali\" (channels).\n\nThis was famously mistranslated into English as \"canals\", leading some English speakers to believe that the Martian structures had been built by an intelligent native populace.\n\nSuch misinterpretation could have led to the conclusion that likewise similarly mammoth structures on Earth would be visible from elsewhere in the Solar System.\n\nIt was during the Apollo missions that the myth of being able to see the Great Wall of China from the surface of the Moon was empirically debunked.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n\"No man-made object is visible at this scale.\"\n\nBut what about seeing the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station?\n\nWell, on 24 November 2004, an image of the Great Wall of China was captured from low Earth orbit by US astronaut and International Space Station Commander Leroy Chiao.\n\nHis image can be seen below. It was captured with a digital camera and 180mm lens.... The image shows central Inner Mongolia, and the yellow arrow indicates an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E, where the wall is visible, according to this great NASA webpage on the subject.\n\nThe red arrows supposedly point to other visible sections of the wall.\n\nAnd then there's ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst's photo of the Great Wall of China from space, captured from the International Space Station on 19 June 2018.\n\nAt the time, Gerst posted on social media: \"I think I finally found the answer to a question I've been asked a 1000 times. Can we see the Great Wall of China from the ISS?\n\n\"Next to impossible with the naked eye. But I tried with an 800 mm tele lens. Still tough to spot. What do you think, is this it?\"\n\nSo while the Great Wall of China can be photographed or observed from space using magnification, it can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThis was confirmed by China's own first astronaut, Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth 14 times in October 2003 during the Chinese space agency's Shenzhou 5 mission.\n\n\"The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall,\" he said.\n\n**Read more:** **Where is the coldest place on Earth?** **What colour is the Sun?** **How long does it take to travel around the world?**... **Other structures visible from space**\n\nPlenty of other human-made structures can be seen from space, including - famously - the Pyramids of Giza, which were photographed during International Space Station Expedition 32.\n\nAnd some of the most impressive images taken of Earth from the ISS include views of Earth at night, where the bright lights of cities highlight the most populated regions.\n\nIn this image of Ireland captured from the ISS, the cities of Belfast, Dublin and Cork are most prominent.\n\nSimiliarly, below is a view of the Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia, captured from onboard the International Space Station.\n\nHumanity's presence is clearly seen by the concentrated pockets of artificial light, which glow brightly against the background darkness of the cosmos.\n\nSo while it turns out the Great Wall of China can't be seen from space with the naked eye, there are plenty of other signifiers that life exists on planet Earth, should any interstellar explorers happen to chance upon our Solar System.\n\n**For more on observing Earth from space, read our interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.**",

It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected.

                "snippet": "**Artificial structures visible from space** without magnification include highways, dams, and cities.\n\nWhether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.... ## Examples\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 mi (217 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clearly visible at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\n### Cooling pond of Chernobyl\n\nThe 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) long cooling pond of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is visible from space. In April 1997 it was photographed from the *Mir* space station, which was in orbit somewhere between 296 km (184 mi) and 421 km (262 mi).\n\n### The Greenhouses of Almería\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers about 26 thousand hectares (64 thousand acres; 100 square miles) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain is visible from space. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Plastic sea\" (\"Mar de plástico\" in Spanish) due to the high concentration of these greenhouse structures.\n\nThis area produces much of the fruit and vegetables that are sold in the rest of Spain and Europe. Apart from the area depicted in the photo, other zones of the province of Almería (and also the south of Spain) have large concentrations of white-plastic greenhouses too.\n\n### Bingham Canyon Mine\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest human-made excavation in the world.... ## Misconceptions\n\n### The Great Wall of China\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the Moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims were historically made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17 000 times better than the norm to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nThe centimetre-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar of STS-59 and STS-68 was able to detect not only the Great Wall but also invisible buried segments of it.\n\n## Theoretical calculation of visibility from the ISS\n\nThe human naked eye has an angular resolution of approximately 280 microradians (μrad) (approx 0.016° or 1 minute of arc), and the ISS targets an altitude of 400 km. Using basic trigonometric relations, this means that an astronaut on the ISS with 20/20 vision could potentially detect objects that are 112 m or greater in all dimensions. However, since this would be at the absolute limit of the resolution, objects on the order of 100 m would appear as unidentifiable specks, if not rendered invisible due to other factors, such as atmospheric conditions or poor contrast. For readability of text from the ISS, using the same trigonometric principles and a recommended character size of about 18 arcminutes, or about 5,000 μrad, each letter would need to be about 2 km (1.3 mi) in size for clear legibility in good conditions.... ## See also\n- First images of Earth from space\n- Naked-eye planets\n- *Deck the Halls*, a 2006 film that features a man who attempts to get his Christmas lights display visible from space\n\n## Notes\n\n## External links\n- Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth",

Some people believe that the Great Wall is visible from space, while others argue that it is not.What's the right answer?The short answer is that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit, which is where most manned space missions take place. According to NASA, the lowest altitude for a human-made object to be visible from space is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) above the Earth's surface. However, the Great Wall is only about 8 meters (26 feet) wide, which is too narrow to be seen from that altitude.Even from higher orbits, such as those of the International Space Station (ISS), the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye. Astronauts on the ISS can see many landmarks on Earth, but the Great Wall is not one of them.What astronaut have to sayNeil Armstrong, the first person to step on the moon, revealed in many interviews that he did not see any man-made structures from the lunar surface. Armstrong reported that he only saw natural features such as continents, lakes, and scattered white spots on a blue background.\"... The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It's hard to see even from the International Space Station,\" reported NASA, Earth Observatory. In 2004, NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao managed to capture a photo of the Great Wall of China from the International Space Station, which orbits 408 kilometers above the Earth. However, Chiao himself said, \"I've been asked many times if the Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon. It's not.\" 98935553This photo of central Inner Mongolia, about 200 miles north of Beijing, was taken on November 24, 2004, from the International Space Station. The yellow arrow points to an estimated location of 42.5N 117.4E where the wall is visible. The red arrows point to other visible sections of the wall. (Photo and Caption Credit: NASA)Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, also confirmed the same, stating, \"The Great Wall is a wonderful structure, but it's not visible from space.\" So why do some people claim the Great Wall is visible from space? One reason is that some early astronauts reported seeing the Great Wall from space. However, their sightings have been debunked. The Great Wall is only about 30 feet wide and made of materials that blend into the surrounding terrain, making it very difficult to see from orbit.While the Great Wall of China is an impressive landmark, it is not visible from space with the naked eye. Despite some early astronauts claiming the sightings, modern astronauts and space agencies confirm that the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit or even higher orbits such as those of the ISS.",

Credit: Canva\n\n“The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure that is visible from space.” As kids, this was one of the most popular statements that made us wonder at the sheer size of this wall. And this statement has stuck around for a long time; in fact from before the first man planted his feet on the moon. In 1754, English scientist and antiquarian Rev. William Stukeley wrote in a private letter about \"the Chinese wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon.\"\n\nBut the answer is simple and this persistent myth has been debunked countless times by astronauts and scientists alike, specifically by those who have actually been to space - NO.\n\nApollo 12 Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean is quoted as saying: \"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation.\n\n## The Great Wall Is Not Visible From Space To The Naked Eye\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall is visible from space has captured the public imagination for decades. Its sheer length and historical significance contribute to this misconception. However, the vastness of space and the relatively small size of the wall compared to the Earth make it impossible to see without advanced optical equipment.\n\nEven from the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits relatively close to Earth, the Great Wall is barely distinguishable without high-powered cameras and zoom lenses. Astronauts have consistently reported that other man-made structures, such as large cities or highways, are far more visible from orbit.\n\nThe Great Wall, while impressive in scale, is simply too narrow and blends in too much with its surroundings to be seen by the human eye from the perspective of space.... ## Are Any Other Structures Visible From Space?Yes. While the Great Wall of China is not visible from space, plenty of other human-made structures can be seen from orbit.

                "snippet": "#### Space Myth\n\nSince 1904, people have been claiming that the Great Wall of China is so big and so prominent, that it can be seen from the surface of the moon. After years of waiting, Apollo astronauts were able to confirm the authenticity of this claim. Their answer: no.\n\nAlan Bean, of the Apollo 12 mission, recounts that all you can really make out on the Earth are lots of white clouds and snow, some blue patches, a little bit of yellow, and, every once in a while, a patch of green.\n\n“No man-made object is visible at this scale.” — Alan Bean, Apollo 12 astronaut.\n\n#### A Closer Look\n\nThe Chinese space program shook upon learning that their astronaut, Yang Liwei, couldn’t see the wall from space. This at least confirmed the invisibility wasn’t a political conspiracy.\n\nAfter numerous missions to space, by astronauts from countries all over the world, nobody could see the wall. The International Space Station, which is 238,601 miles closer to the Earth than the Moon, or only 0.1% as far away, still offers no view of the Wall with the naked eye.\n\n#### Finally Photographed\n\nIt was Chinese-American astronaut Leroy Chiao who would eventually spot the wall using a camera and 180mm lens. Even then, he could only identify a small portion of it. For refference, the human eye can see about 50mm.\n\nChiao took another photograph using a 400mm lens, and experts were even less sure that he had taken a photo of the actual wall. Favorable snowfall and sunlight had seemed to be largely responsible for photographing the wall the first time.\n\nNASA says the Great Wall is hard to photograph, but low-orbit satellites can use radar to capture it.",

                "snippet": "Question: Can You See the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nQuick Answer: No, the Great Wall is not visible to the naked eye from space due to its narrow width and natural coloring that blends into the landscape.\n\n## 🧠 1. Debunking the Myth: A Common Misconception\n\nYou may have heard the claim that\n\n*“the Great Wall is the only man-made object visible from space.”*\n\nThis statement is false and has been debunked by astronauts and scientists. The myth likely originated in early 20th-century Western media and was reinforced by popular imagination.\n\n## 🛰️ 2. What Science and Astronauts Say\n\n**Visual limits in orbit**:\n\nFrom low Earth orbit (LEO) (~400 km, the height of the ISS), human eyesight can distinguish features at least 20–30 meters wide.\n\nThe Great Wall averages only 4–5 meters in width, far below this threshold.\n\n**Comparison examples**: **Visible from space**: Large airport runways, city grids, Dubai’s Palm Islands **Hard to detect**: The Great Wall, due to its narrow profile and earth-toned color that blends into hills and deserts\n\n**Astronaut testimonies**: **Yang Liwei**(China’s first astronaut, 2003): *“I didn’t see the Great Wall from space.”* **Buzz Aldrin**and other ISS crew members have also confirmed: *The Great Wall is not visible with the unaided eye.*\n\n\n\n*Only with zoom lenses and under ideal conditions (like snow cover or strong shadows) might small portions be detectable in satellite images.*... ## 🤔 3. Why the Myth Persisted\n\n**Cultural projection**:\n\nThe Great Wall is a symbol of ancient grandeur — people\n\n*want* it to be the ultimate monument. The myth reflects emotional reverence rather than scientific accuracy.\n\n**Special cases misinterpreted**:\n\nIf astronauts know the Wall’s location, use telescopes, and lighting conditions are perfect, they might spot short sections, but this is not the same as seeing it clearly with the naked eye.\n\n## 🏯 4. The Wall’s True Visibility: Cultural, Not Ocular\n\nEven if the Great Wall can’t be seen from orbit, it doesn’t need space-based validation to prove its greatness:\n\n**Length**: Over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China **History**: Built across 2,000+ years, involving millions of workers **Symbolism**: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it represents resilience, unity, and China’s deep civilizational roots",

Imagine standing in orbit hundreds of kilome above Earth and looking down. Can\n{ts:20} you spot the ancient structure that snakes across China? Many people believe the Great Wall of China is visible from\n{ts:27} space. But is that really true? The truth is a bit more complicated. The Great Wall stretches nearly 9,000 km,\n{ts:36} but its width is only about 4 to 5 m. That's roughly the size of a single lane road. From low Earth orbit, which is\n{ts:45} where the International Space Station orbits, objects this narrow are very hard to see without help.\n{ts:52} The materials used to build the wall were sourced locally, so its color blends in with the surrounding\n{ts:57} landscape. This makes it even harder to distinguish from space. Astronauts, including China's first astronaut, Yang\n{ts:64} Leeway, have said they could not see the wall with their naked eyes during their missions. Photographs taken from space\n{ts:71} show that even with powerful zoom lenses, spotting the wall is very difficult.... {ts:77} Large structures like cities, airports, or dams are much easier to see because they are bigger, brighter, or emit light\n{ts:85} at night. The myth that the Great Wall is visible from space has been around for a long time, but it is not\n{ts:92} scientifically accurate. The wall is a remarkable archaeological site and a symbol of China's ancient civilization\n{ts:99} and engineering skills. It was built over many dynasties starting from the Qin dynasty around 275\n{ts:107} BC. The wall served as a defense, a way to control trade and a symbol of strength.\n{ts:114} Today, it remains a UNESCO world heritage site and a major tourist attraction.\n{ts:120} So, while the Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked, it still holds immense cultural and\n{ts:126} historical importance. Its size and history make it one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world.\n{ts:133} Remember, the idea that it is visible from space is a myth, but its significance is clear to everyone who\n{ts:140} visits or studies it.

                "snippet": "The Great Wall of China cannot be seen from space with the naked eye. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. While the Wall is large, its visibility is beyond the observational limits of regular eyesight. Powerful magnification can capture images of it from space.\n\nFurthermore, satellite imaging reveals that many structures are far more visible than the Great Wall. Urban centers and large highways appear more distinct due to their contrasting colors compared to the surrounding environment. Therefore, claiming that the Great Wall can be seen from space oversimplifies the perspective from which we view our planet.\n\nUnderstanding these misconceptions leads to a deeper exploration of how we perceive monumental structures. Next, we will delve into the significance of the Great Wall of China, its historical context, and its impact on Chinese culture and identity.... ## Can the Great Wall of China Be Seen from Low Earth Orbit?\n\nNo, the Great Wall of China cannot be distinctly seen from low Earth orbit. It is often said that the Wall is visible from space, but this is a misconception.\n\nThe Wall integrates with the landscape, using natural materials that blend into its surroundings. From low Earth orbit, astronauts report that the Wall is challenging to discern due to its narrow width and similarity to the terrain. The wall’s color and texture often match the earth, which makes it blend in. During clear weather, specific portions may be visible, but they do not stand out significantly compared to other features on Earth, such as cities or rivers.... ### What Do Astronauts Say About the Visibility of the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nAstronauts report that the Great Wall of China is generally not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. The structure blends into the natural landscape and lacks distinctive color compared to its surroundings.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\n– Many astronauts state the Great Wall is usually not visible.\n\n– The wall’s colors match the natural terrain.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\n– Atmospheric conditions affect visibility.\n\n– Lighting and distance can obscure details.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\n– City structures are often more visible than the Wall.\n\n– Bright lights of cities stand out against the dark sky.\n\nThese insights reflect a combination of astronaut experience and scientific understanding. Exploring these factors provides further clarity on the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space.\n\n\n\nVisibility to the Naked Eye:\n\nVisibility to the naked eye regarding the Great Wall of China varies based on specific conditions. Astronauts have consistently noted that the structure is not easily discernible from low Earth orbit. According to astronaut Chris Hadfield, it is a common misconception that the Wall can be seen, as its colors closely match the natural environment. This blending makes it difficult for the human eye to identify the Wall amidst the earth tones of the landscape.\n\n\n\nOptical and Environmental Factors:\n\nOptical and environmental factors influence the visibility of the Great Wall. Various atmospheric conditions, such as haze or pollution, can obscure vision from space. Additionally, the angle of sunlight impacts how well certain features, including the Wall, are illuminated. When viewed from the International Space Station, smaller details may vanish amidst the vastness of the surrounding area. Scientific literature suggests that visibility can be affected by these variables, emphasizing the importance of context when assessing what is visible from space.\n\n\n\nUrban Infrastructure:\n\nUrban infrastructure is often more noticeable than natural or historical landmarks like the Great Wall. Brightly lit cities present a stark contrast to the darker surroundings, making them prominent even from great distances. Astronauts often describe urban areas as glowing spots against the night sky. This highlights a shift in what is visually significant from space. Reports from various astronauts confirm that they find cities and other man-made structures easier to identify than extensive natural or historical constructions.... ## Why Do People Believe the Great Wall of China Is Visible from Space?\n\nPeople believe the Great Wall of China is visible from space due to its length and historical significance. However, this idea is a misconception because, from low Earth orbit, the wall is often indistinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nNASA provides clarification on visibility from space. According to NASA, “Most human-made structures are too small to see from Low Earth Orbit without aid.” Their definition emphasizes that visibility depends on size, contrast, and the observer’s altitude.\n\nSeveral reasons contribute to this misconception. First, the Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles, making it one of the longest man-made structures in the world. Second, its extensive network often gets confused with other large features like rivers or roads. Finally, the popular culture and myths surrounding the wall have perpetuated the belief through stories and media.\n\nThe term “low Earth orbit” refers to an orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 100 to 1,200 miles. At these heights, visibility is affected by factors such as distance, weather, and the observer’s perspective. The Great Wall blends into the terrain due to its materials and color, making it hard to discern.\n\nVisibility from space involves specific mechanisms. Astronauts may spot the Great Wall, but doing so requires favorable conditions. Good lighting, lack of cloud cover, and a clear line of sight are essential for visibility. Even then, the wall looks no more prominent than other structures like roads or fields.\n\nCertain conditions impact the visibility of the Great Wall. For example, when viewed during sunrise or sunset, shadows may enhance features temporarily. However, under standard conditions, the wall’s natural tones match the landscape, reducing its visibility against background features like mountains and forests.... These structures and patterns reveal the extent of human impact on the Earth, providing a unique perspective when viewed from space.... ## What Common Misconceptions Exist About Viewing the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe common misconception is that the Great Wall of China is easily visible from space. However, this is not accurate as it blends into the natural landscape and is often too narrow to be seen with the naked eye.\n\n- The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space.\n\n- The Great Wall blends in with the terrain.\n\n- Astronauts have contradicted this misconception.\n\n- The visibility depends on altitude and viewing conditions.\n\n- Satellite images can show its presence but not always clearly.\n\nThis discussion reveals different perspectives on the visibility of the Great Wall from space, further clarifying the facts surrounding this historical structure.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall is too narrow to be seen from space**: The Great Wall of China has an average width of around 12-30 feet and can vary depending on the location. At an altitude of approximately 200 miles, such as where the International Space Station orbits, the human eye cannot distinguish objects that small. NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield confirmed that while in space, he could not see the wall with the unaided eye, as it is too narrow to discern.\n\n\n\n**The Great Wall blends in with the terrain**: The materials used to construct the Great Wall are primarily local stone and earth, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the hills and valleys around it. This camouflage effect makes it even less visible from space. A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlights how environmental conditions and foliage further obscure the Wall’s visibility from high altitudes.... ## What Documentation or Research Is Available About Viewing the Great Wall of China from Space?\n\nThe idea that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a misconception. Astronauts report that it is difficult to distinguish the Wall with the naked eye from low Earth orbit because it blends in with the surrounding environment.\n\n- Misconceptions about visibility\n\n- Astronaut testimonials\n\n- Satellite imagery\n\n- Environmental blending\n\n- Perspective and viewing conditions\n\nThe misconceptions surrounding the visibility of the Great Wall from space have generated various opinions and interpretations regarding its clarity from orbit.\n\n**Misconceptions About Visibility**: The misconception that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space stems from popular culture. Many sources state that it is one of the few manmade structures visible to the naked eye from space. However, this claim has been widely discredited by space professionals.\n\nVisibility depends on many factors, including distance, weather conditions, and altitude. For example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts confirm that while some manmade features can be seen from space, the Wall is not among them.\n\n**Astronaut Testimonials**: Astronauts have shared their experiences about viewing the Earth from orbit. They report seeing large cities, roads, and other features but often fail to identify the Great Wall. In 2003, astronaut Yang Liwei, China’s first man in space, commented that the Wall is nearly impossible to see.... These testimonials highlight the reality of space viewing, emphasizing that detail is often lost at high altitudes.\n\n**Satellite Imagery**: Satellite imagery provides an accurate way to visualize the Great Wall while not demonstrating visibility from space. High-resolution satellite images reveal sections of the Wall, showing its structure and course. Companies like DigitalGlobe have produced clear images, but they use advanced technology that overcomes the limitations faced by human observers.\n\nThis approach indicates the importance of using technology to uncover features unrecognizable to the human eye.\n\n**Environmental Blending**: The Great Wall’s materials and local landscape contribute to its blending into the environment. Built primarily of stone, earth, and wood, the Wall’s color and texture mimic the surrounding rocks and vegetation. This natural camouflage hampers visibility from great distances.\n\nAccording to correlation studies by environmental scientists, the patterning and coloration of structures play crucial roles in their visibility against natural backdrops.\n\n**Perspective and Viewing Conditions**: Different perspectives and viewing conditions affect how the Great Wall can be seen. In low Earth orbit, at approximately 200 to 400 kilometers above Earth, external factors such as light levels, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions further challenge visibility.\n\nPreferred viewing times under optimal conditions are essential for identifying features from space. Hence, astronauts emphasize that from space, multiple factors limit the ability to see the Wall.... In conclusion, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is unsupported by evidence and astronaut experiences. Understanding visibility involves analyzing various factors including environmental context and technological abilities.\n\n**Related Post:**",

                "snippet": "# Can You Really See the Great Wall of China From Space?\n\nFor decades, a popular myth has persisted: that the Great Wall of China is the only human-made structure visible from space with the naked eye. This statement, often repeated in classrooms and trivia nights, has captivated our imaginations, fueling a sense of awe at the scale of human achievement. However, the truth is far more nuanced.\n\n**What We Can See from Space**\n\nAstronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 100 to 300 miles can indeed see quite a bit of our planet's surface. Large-scale artificial structures become discernible, particularly those with contrasting colors against their surroundings. Highways cutting through deserts, sprawling cities illuminated at night, and massive dams holding back vast reservoirs – these are all visible from low Earth orbit.\n\n**Debunking the Myth**\n\nThe Great Wall, despite its impressive length of over 13,000 miles, blends surprisingly well with the surrounding landscape. Constructed primarily from stone and earth, its color palette doesn't offer much contrast against the browns and greens of Northern China. Furthermore, the Wall's width, averaging around 20 feet, makes it relatively thin and difficult to distinguish from such a distance.\n\nWhile some astronauts have claimed to have glimpsed the Great Wall under seemingly perfect conditions – with optimal lighting and minimal atmospheric interference – these sightings remain contested and difficult to verify. Even with the aid of binoculars or a telephoto lens, spotting the Wall from space can be a challenge.... **The Power of Perspective**\n\nIt's important to note that visibility from space is highly dependent on factors like altitude, lighting, atmospheric conditions, and even the visual acuity of the observer. What appears clear and distinct from a certain vantage point might be completely obscured from another.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe myth of the Great Wall's unique visibility from space serves as a reminder that our perception of the world is often shaped by narratives rather than factual evidence. While the Great Wall remains an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human ingenuity, it's time to retire the notion that it holds this cosmic distinction.\n\n**Q&A**\n\n**Q1: If not the Great Wall, what other human-made structures are visible from space?**\n\n**A1:** Large structures with distinct shapes and contrasting colors against their surroundings are easily visible. Examples include highways crossing deserts, sprawling cities, particularly at night when illuminated, and massive dams.\n\n**Q2: Why is the Great Wall difficult to see from space, even though it's so long?**\n\n**A2:** The Wall's color blends in with the surrounding terrain, and its width is relatively narrow, making it hard to distinguish from orbit.\n\n**Q3: Does the myth of the Great Wall's visibility from space diminish its significance?**\n\n**A3:** Not at all. The Great Wall remains a remarkable achievement in human history, showcasing engineering prowess and cultural heritage. It doesn't need this mythical distinction to be considered a wonder.",

                "snippet": "The Great Wall can be seen from space, but only from low earth orbit distance and in the right conditions. It can't be seen from the moon.\n\n## Why the Great Wall Can't Be Seen from Space… Easily\n\nThe Great Wall we see from Earth might be very magnificent, but it is only just possible for the naked eye to see it from outer space (100 km upwards). It would be like seeing a cotton thread on the ground from a fifth-story window (upwards).\n\n**Experts now say** that only someone with sharp eyes in a low earth orbit (160 km above Earth) can pick out certain sections of the wall in excellent viewing conditions if they know exactly where it is. However, it is much easier to see other constructions, such as highways or canals, such as the Grand Canal, since they stand out more clearly.\n\nBesides, much of the Great Wall is crumbling, and much of it\n\n**matches the color of the land** because it was made of mud bricks or rock cut from the surrounding mountains. The Great Wall follows the ridges, which makes it hard to distinguish from the mountains' shape.\n\n## Modern Photographic Evidence\n\nIn 2004, an American astronaut named\n\n**Leroy Chiao** took a photograph of a region about 200 miles north of Beijing. The sun was at the right angle to cast a long shadow, and experts said the Great Wall was visible in the picture.\n\nLeroy Chiao confirmed that the Great Wall can only be\n\n**photographed from space** in very good viewing conditions from a lower earth orbit by someone who is quite familiar with the geographic position of the Great Wall.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:... ## Who Said the Great Wall Can Be Seen from Space\n\nThe idea started in Europe. English writer William Stukeley wrote in 1754, without evidence or qualification, that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon.\n\nGradually this idea was popularized, and the Chinese even made it a matter of national pride.\n\n## What Did Astronauts Say about the Great Wall from Space?\n\nThe second person to walk on the moon,\n\n**Buzz Aldrin**, made the first lunar landing with commander Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969. When asked whether he could see the Great Wall from space or not, he said he didn't see it— it was a great misunderstanding [that the Great Wall could be seen from the moon].\n\n**Jeffrey Alan Hoffman**, the former American astronaut, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, announced that he had not seen the Wall no matter how much time he spent overlooking the earth.\n\n**Dennis Anthony Tito**, the first space tourist from America, went on his space vacation in 2001, and also said the Wall was invisible from the space.\n\n**Yang Liwei,** China's first astronaut, who went to space on Shenzhou 5 in 2003, also gave the answer \"no\" to the reporter who asked if he'd seen the Great Wall after he arrived back on Earth.\n\n*Recommended*Tours:\n\n- 3-Day Jiankou to Jinshanling Great Wall Hiking Discovery Tour\n\n- 5-Day Badaling to Huangyaguan Great Wall Hiking Tour... ## The Original Wall Is Getting Harder to See from Space\n\nNorthern areas of China are increasingly smoggy and dusty, so it is getting harder to see the wall every year.\n\nThe Great Wall was last extensively built up and reinforced by the Ming Dynasty (1644–1912), but nowadays most of it has\n\n**eroded**, hastened by acid rain near more industrial areas. Some have been **torn down** for construction. Without protection, the Wall will disappear from some places completely!\n\nHowever, a few places, such as the sections near Beijing that tourists go to, have been rebuilt or protected. These are now\n\n**the most easily seen sections from space**.\n\n## Why You Should See the Great Wall with Us\n\nThe Great Wall is a national symbol and China's most popular tourist attraction.

                "snippet": "# The Great Wall of China is Visible from Space: A Fact-Check\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe claim that \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space\" has persisted for decades, often cited as a testament to the wall's immense scale. This assertion has been popularized in various forms, including the notion that it is the only man-made structure visible from the Moon. However, the validity of this claim has been scrutinized by experts and scientists. This article explores the evidence surrounding this claim and examines the reliability of the sources that discuss it.\n\n## What We Know\n\n\n\n**Visibility from Space**: The consensus among experts is that the Great Wall of China is not easily visible from space with the naked eye. A 2010 article published in *PMC*states that even the best human eyes cannot see the wall from space due to its narrowness and the surrounding landscape 1.\n\n\n\n**Astronaut Accounts**: Astronauts have reported that the wall is difficult to see from low Earth orbit. For instance, Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut, stated that he could not see the wall during his mission in 2003 5.\n\n\n\n**NASA's Position**: NASA has produced images of the Great Wall taken from the International Space Station (ISS), but these images require photographic equipment to capture the structure clearly, indicating that it is not visible to the naked eye 2.\n\n\n\n**Myth Origins**: The claim that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon likely originated from a 1932 cartoon published by Ripley's Believe It or Not! 10. This myth has persisted despite a lack of evidence supporting it.\n\n\n\n**Pollution and Coloration**: Factors such as pollution and the wall's coloration make it even less visible from space. According to *Scientific American*, the wall blends into its surroundings, making it challenging to distinguish from the landscape 6.... ## Analysis\n\nThe sources discussing the visibility of the Great Wall of China from space vary in their credibility and potential biases:\n\n\n\n**Scientific and Academic Sources**: Articles from *Scientific American*and *PMC*provide scientifically grounded perspectives. They rely on expert opinions and empirical evidence, making them reliable for understanding the limitations of human vision and the challenges of visibility from space 16.\n\n\n\n**NASA**: As a leading authority in space exploration, NASA's images and statements carry significant weight. Their documentation of the Great Wall, while visually impressive, reinforces the idea that visibility is not feasible without specialized equipment 2.\n\n\n\n**Popular Media**: Sources like *Snopes*and *Britannica*offer fact-checking perspectives that clarify the myth's origins and its perpetuation over time. They emphasize the distinction between popular belief and scientific reality 38.\n\n\n\n**Potential Bias**: Some sources, such as *Times Now News*and *Jagran Josh*, may have a more sensationalist approach, focusing on the myth's cultural significance rather than providing a rigorous scientific analysis 49. This could lead to a skewed representation of the facts.\n\n\n\n**Methodological Concerns**: While many sources cite astronaut accounts and scientific studies, the methodology behind these claims is not always transparent. For example, how visibility was assessed or the specific conditions under which observations were made are often not detailed.... ## Conclusion\n\n**Verdict: False**\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is false. Key evidence supporting this conclusion includes expert consensus indicating that the wall is too narrow and blends into its surroundings, making it nearly impossible to see with the naked eye from space. Astronaut accounts, including those from Yang Liwei, further corroborate this, as they have reported difficulty in spotting the wall even from low Earth orbit. Additionally, NASA's imagery demonstrates that specialized photographic equipment is necessary to capture the wall clearly, reinforcing the assertion that it is not visible without aid.\n\nIt is important to note that while the myth of the Great Wall's visibility has cultural significance and has been popularized over time, it lacks scientific support. The origins of this myth can be traced back to a 1932 cartoon, which highlights how misinformation can persist despite a lack of evidence.\n\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations in the available evidence. Visibility can depend on various factors, including atmospheric conditions and the observer's location. Thus, while the consensus is clear, there may be specific scenarios where visibility could be marginally improved, though this does not substantiate the claim as a general truth.\n\nReaders are encouraged to critically evaluate information and consider the sources and evidence behind claims, especially those that have become entrenched in popular belief.... ## Sources\n\n- López-Gil, N.
